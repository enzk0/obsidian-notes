## PII, PHI, PSI
---
The economic impact of cyberattacks is difficult to determine with precision. However, it is estimated that businesses will lose over $5 trillion annually by 2024 due to cyberattacks.

***Personally identifiable information (PII)*** is any information that can be used to positively identify an individual. Examples of PII include:

- Name
- Social security number
- Birthdate
- Credit card numbers
- Bank account numbers
- Government issued ID
- Address information (street, email, phone numbers)

One of the more lucrative goals of cybercriminals is obtaining lists of PII that can then be *sold* on the *dark web*. The dark web can only be accessed with special software and is used by cybercriminals to shield their activities. Stolen PII can be used to create fake financial accounts, such as credit cards and short-term loans.

A subset of PII is ***protected health information (PHI)***. The medical community creates and maintains ***electronic medical records (EMRs)*** that contain PHI. In the U.S., handling of PHI is regulated by the ***Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)***. In the European Union the ***General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)*** protects a broad range of personal information in including health records.

***Personal security information (PSI)*** is another type of PII. This information includes *usernames*, *passwords*, and other *security-related information* that individuals use to access information or services on the network. According to a 2019 report by Verizon, the second most common way that threat actors breached a network was by using stolen PSI.

Most hacks on companies and organizations that have been reported in the news involved stolen PII or PHI. Recent examples are:

- In 2019, an online graphic design tool website experienced a data breach in which PII for approximately 137 million users was viewed by hackers with user details for 4 million accounts appearing on the internet.
- In 2020, a major Chinese social media company was hacked resulting in theft of PII, including phone numbers, stolen from 172 million users. The theft did not include passwords, so the data was available for a low price on the internet.
- In 2019, a company that makes games that are played on Facebook was hacked and the PII of 218 million users was stolen.

## Lost Competitive Advantage
---
Companies are increasingly worried about *corporate espionage* in cyberspace. The *loss of intellectual property* to competitors is a serious concern. An additional major concern is the *loss of trust* that comes when a company is unable to protect its customers’ personal data. The *loss of competitive advantage* may come from this *loss of trust* rather than another company or country stealing trade secrets.


## Politics and National Security
---
It is not just businesses that get hacked. In February 2016, a hacker published the personal information of 20,000 U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) employees and 9,000 U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) employees. The hacker was apparently politically motivated.

The Stuxnet worm was specifically designed to impede Iran’s progress in enriching uranium that could be used in a nuclear weapon. Stuxnet is a prime example of a network attack motivated by national security concerns. *Cyberwarfare* is a serious possibility. State-supported hacker warriors can cause disruption and destruction of vital services and resources within an enemy nation. The internet has become essential as a medium for commercial and financial activities. Disruption of these activities can devastate a nation’s economy. Controllers, similar to those attacked by Stuxnet, also are used to control the flow of water at dams and the switching of electricity on the power grid. Attacks on such controllers can have dire consequences.

> ***Cyberwarfare*** is **a series of strategic cyber attacks against a nation-state, causing it significant harm**. This harm could include disruption of vital computer systems up to the loss of life.
