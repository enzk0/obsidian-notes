## ICMP
### ICMPv4 Messages
---
- ICMP's purpose is to provide messages that are feedbacks on issues related to the processing of IP packets under certain conditions.
- ICMP can both mean ICMPv4 and ICMPv6, both provide the same functionality, the latter just has more additional functionality
- Common ICMP messages:
	1. Host Confirmation
	2. Destination or Service Unreachable
		0 - Net Unreachable
		1 - Host Unreachable
		2 - Protocol Unreachable
		3 - Port Unreachable
	3. Time Exceeded
		- Time to Live or TTL of a packet is 0
	4. Route Redirection

### ICMPv6 RS and RA Messages
---
Features that are found in ICMPv6 and not in ICMPv4

#### Messaging between an IPv6 router and an IPv6 device:
- Router Solicitation (RS) message
- Router Advertisement (RA) message

#### Messaging between IPv6 devices:
- Neighbor Solicitation (NS) message
- Neighbor Advertisement (NA) message

| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Router Solicitation         | 1. RA messages are sent by routers to provide addressing information to hosts using Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC)<br><br>2. When a host is configured to obtain its addressing information automatically using SLAAC, the host will send an RS message to the router requesting an RA message.                                                               |
| Address Resolution          | 1. NS messages are sent when a device knows the IPv6 address of a device but does not know its MAC address. This is equivalent to an ARP Request for IPv4.<br><br>2. NA messages are sent in response to an NS message and match the target IPv6 address in the NS. The NA message includes the device’s Ethernet MAC address. This is equivalent to an ARP Reply in IPv4. |
| Duplicate Address Detection | Checks if if an address is unique, especially to global unicast or link-local address. It sends an NS message with its own IPv6 as its target. If another device already has this address, it will respond an NA message, otherwise, after some time if there are no NA messages, the address will be deemed unique and acceptable for  use.                               |

### Traceroute
---
tracert, a command used to generate a list of hops that were successfully reached along a path. Provides verification and troubleshooting information.

**Round Trip Time (RTT)**
Using traceroute provides round-trip time for each hop along the path and indicates if a hop fails to respond. The round-trip time is the time a packet takes to reach the remote host and for the response from the host to return. An asterisk is used to indicate a lost or unreplied packet.

This information can be used to locate a problematic router in the path or may indicate that the router is configured not to reply. If the display shows high response times or data losses from a particular hop, this is an indication that the resources of the router or its connections may be overused.

**IPv4 TTL and IPv6 Hop Limit**
Traceroute makes use of a function of the TTL field in IPv4 and the Hop Limit field in IPv6 in the Layer 3 headers, along with the ICMP Time Exceeded message.

### ICMP Packet Format
---
ICMP is encapsulated directly into IP packets.

ICMP uses message codes to differentiate between different types of ICMP messages. These are some common message codes:

- **0** - Echo reply (response to a ping)
- **3** - Destination Unreachable
- **5** - Redirect (use another route to your destination)
- **8** - Echo request (for ping)
- **11** - Time Exceeded (TTL became 0)


## Summary
**ICMP**

The TCP/IP suite sends ICMP messages when IP packets encounter forwarding problems. However, ICMP messages are not required and are often not allowed within a network for security reasons. ICMPv4 is the messaging protocol for IPv4, while ICMPv6 provides these same services for IPv6 and includes additional functionality. ICMP messages that are common to both ICMPv4 and ICMPv6 include host confirmation, destination or service unreachable, time exceeded, and route redirection. ICMPv6 includes the additional four ICMPv6 messages for the Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP). These messages are router solicitation (RS) and router advertisements (RA) messages that are sent between IPv6 routers and IPv6 hosts, and neighbor solicitation (NS) and neighbor advertisement (NA) messages that are sent between IPv6 devices.

**Ping and Traceroute Utilities**

Ping is an IPv4 and IPv6 testing utility that uses ICMP echo request and echo reply messages to test connectivity between hosts. Some of the types of connectivity tests that are performed with ping include pinging the local loopback, pinging the default gateway, and pinging a remote host. Traceroute (tracert) is a utility that generates a list of the router hops that were successfully reached along a path. This provides important verification and troubleshooting information. Traceroute makes use of a function of the TTL field in IPv4 and the Hop Limit field in the IPv6 Layer 3 headers, along with the ICMP Time Exceeded message. ICMP is encapsulated directly into IP packets as the data payload. The ICMP data payload contains special header data fields.
