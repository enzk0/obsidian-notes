## ICMP
### ICMPv4 Messages
---
- ICMP's purpose is to provide messages that are feedbacks on issues related to the processing of IP packets under certain conditions.
- ICMP can both mean ICMPv4 and ICMPv6, both provide the same functionality, the latter just has more additional functionality
- Common ICMP messages:
	1. Host Confirmation
	2. Destination or Service Unreachable
		0 - Net Unreachable
		1 - Host Unreachable
		2 - Protocol Unreachable
		3 - Port Unreachable
	3. Time Exceeded
		- Time to Live or TTL of a packet is 0
	4. Route Redirection

### ICMPv6 RS and RA Messages
---
Features that are found in ICMPv6 and not in ICMPv4

#### Messaging between an IPv6 router and an IPv6 device:
- Router Solicitation (RS) message
- Router Advertisement (RA) message

#### Messaging between IPv6 devices:
- Neighbor Solicitation (NS) message
- Neighbor Advertisement (NA) message

| Router Solicitation         | 1. RA messages are sent by routers to provide addressing information to hosts using Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC)<br><br>2. When a host is configured to obtain its addressing information automatically using SLAAC, the host will send an RS message to the router requesting an RA message.                                                               |
| Address Resolution          | 1. NS messages are sent when a device knows the IPv6 address of a device but does not know its MAC address. This is equivalent to an ARP Request for IPv4.<br><br>2. NA messages are sent in response to an NS message and match the target IPv6 address in the NS. The NA message includes the deviceâ€™s Ethernet MAC address. This is equivalent to an ARP Reply in IPv4. |
| Duplicate Address Detection | Checks if if an address is unique, especially to global unicast or link-local address. It sends an NS message with its own IPv6 as its target. If another device already has this address, it will respond an NA message, otherwise, after some time if there are no NA messages, the address will be deemed unique and acceptable for  use.                               |

### Traceroute

tracert, a command used to generate a list of hops that were successfully reached along a path.
