## Disk Operating System
---
- The first computers did not have modern storage devices such as hard drives, optical drives, or flash storage. 
- The first storage methods used punch cards, paper tape, magnetic tape, and even audio cassettes.
- Floppy disk and hard disk storage require software to read from, write to, and manage the data that they store. 
- The Disk Operating System (DOS) is an operating system that the computer uses to enable these data storage devices to read and write files. 
- DOS provides a file system which organizes the files in a specific way on the disk. Microsoft bought DOS and developed MS-DOS.
- MS-DOS used a command line as the interface for people to create programs and manipulate data files, as shown in the command output. DOS commands are shown in bold text.
