## Difference between Verification and Validation
---
> [!TERM] Software Verification and Validation (V&V)
> - a technical discipline of systems engineering.
> - parallel with software development, *not* at the end of development
> 

_"a systems engineering process employing a rigorous methodology for evaluating the correctness and quality of software product through the software life cycle."_ 
													- Stauffer and Fuji (1986)

| ***Verification***                                                                                                   | ***Validation***                                                                               |

| It is a static process of verifying documents, design, and code.                                                     | It is a dynamic process of validating/testing the actual product.                              |
| It does not involve executing the code.                                                                              | It involves executing the code.                                                                |
| It is human based checking of documents/files.                                                                       | It is the computer-based execution of program.                                                 |
| Target is requirements specification, application architecture, high level and detailed design, and database design. | Target is actual product—a unit, a module, a set of integrated modules, and the final product. |
| It uses methods like inspections, walk throughs, desk-checking, etc.                                                 | It uses methods like black-box, gray-box, and white-box testing.                               |
| It, generally, comes first—before validation.                                                                        | It generally follows verification.                                                             |
| It answers the question—Are we building the product right?                                                           | It answers the question—Are we building the right product?                                     |
| It can catch errors that validation cannot catch.                                                                    | It can catch errors that verification cannot catch.                                            |
- Both of these are _essential_ and _complementary._ Each provides its own sets of _error filters._
- Each has its own way of finding the errors in the software

## Difference Between QA and QC
---
> [!Term] ***Quality assurance***
> - a planned and systematic activities implemented in a quality system so that quality requirements for a product or service

> [!Term] ***Quality control***
> - the observation techniques and activities used to fulfill requirements for quality.

Both are, however, *different to each other*. We tabulate The differences between them are shown below.

|Quality Assurance (QA)|Quality Control (QC)|
|---|---|
|1. It is process related.|1. It is product related.|
|2. It focuses on the process used to develop a product.|2. It focuses on testing of a product developed or a product under development.|
|3. It involves the quality of the processes.|3. It involves the quality of the products.|
|4. It is a preventive control.|4. It is a detective control.|
|5. Allegiance is to development.|5. Allegiance is not to development.|
