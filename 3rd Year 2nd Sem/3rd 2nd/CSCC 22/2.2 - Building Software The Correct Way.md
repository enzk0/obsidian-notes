## Overview
---
- Writing software is hard and error prone.
- Software projects fail as teams are unable to cope with software complexity
- Projects that fail to meet deadline costs more and don't deliver intended business value

- Software evolves over time
- Development is a collaborative process.
- Different individuals for different parts with different roles
*"The only constant is change"*

- ***Test-driven development (TDD)***, a popular practice of Agile software development.
- Write a failing test case before writing the production code
- If done correctly, it beneficially writes a software that meets expectations, has a simple design, and fewer defects.

## Test-Driven Development
---
- Software projects have a lot of uncertainties. Due to:
	1. New technologies
	2. Changing requirements
	3. People movement
	4. Combination of all
- Thus to overcome, we need *Software Development Practice,* that is:
	1. simple
	2. provides quick feedback
- ***Test-Driven Development (TDD)***, rediscovered by Kent Beck in 2003
	- A *development practice* increasing *developer confidence* through *advocating tests* for all *software requirements*
	- Makes us work in *short incremental development cycles*, providing quick feedback on our progress
	- Forces us to write a *failing test* before writing *production code*. Process is as follows:
		1. Add a test for the new functionality or behavior.
		2. See it fail.
		3. Write enough code to make the test pass.
		4. Make sure all the previous tests pass as well.
		5. Refactor the code.
		6. Repeat until done.
	- A failing test helps us understand the system
	- Quick feedback is the key to software productivity
	- TDD helps us in achieving these goals:
		1. Detect regression errors.
		2. Keep system design simple.

### Detection Regression Errors

- Detection Regression Errors in an automated manner
