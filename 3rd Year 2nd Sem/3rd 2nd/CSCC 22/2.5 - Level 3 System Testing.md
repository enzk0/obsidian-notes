# System Testing
---
- ***System testing***, a level of software testing where a complete and integrated software is tested. 
- Evaluates the system's compliance with the specified requirements

**ISTQB Definition**  
- **system testing:** The process of testing an integrated system to verify that it meets specified requirements.

## Method
---
- Black Box Testing Method, in which the internal structure of the system under test is unknown, is used.

## Tasks
---
- System Test Plan [Prepare >> Review >> Rework >> Baseline]
- System Test Cases/ Test Scripts/ Test Data [Prepare >> Review >> Rework >> Baseline]
- System Test [Execute >> Re-execute]

### When is it performed?
---
- Done after integration testing and before acceptance testing

### Who performs it?
---
- Normally the independent software testers

## Types

| **System Testing Types**  | **Description**                                                                                    |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ***Smoke Testing***       | ensures that most important functions work and to decide whether the build fit for further testing |
| ***Functional Testing***  | ensure that features work as per the functional requirements.                                      |
| ***Regression Testing***  | ensure that changes (enhancements or defect fixes) to the software have not adversely affected it. |
| ***Usability Testing***   | determine if the system is easily usable from an end-user’s perspective.                           |
| ***Performance Testing*** | determine how the system performs in terms of responsiveness and stability under a certain load.   |
| ***Security Testing***    | uncover vulnerabilities of the system and determine                                                |
| ***Compliance Testing***  | determine the compliance of the system with internal or external standards.                        |
