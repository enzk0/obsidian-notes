# Unit Testing
---
- Unit Testing is also known as *Component Testing*
- It is a level of software testing where it tests individual components validating their performance as designed
- In procedural programming, a unit may be a individual program, function, procedure, etc.
- In object-oriented programming, a unit may be a method, that belongs to a super class, abstract class, or child class.

## Method
---
Unit Testing is usually performed with *White Box* testing and is normally automated

## Tasks
---
- Unit Test Plan [Prepare >> Review >> Rework >> Baseline]
- Unit Test Cases/ Test Scripts/ Test Data [Prepare >> Review >> Rework >> Baseline]
- Unit Test [Execute >> Re-execute]

### When is it performed?
---
- Prior to Integration Testing
- After Coding
- Automated unit tests before coding

### Who performs it?
---
- normally the software developers themselves or their peers
- independent software testers, rarely, but needs understanding of the code and its architecture and design

## How to do Unit Testing
---
- Developers write a section of code to test a specific function in software application. Isolate this function to test it more rigorously which reveals unnecessary dependencies between the function being tested and other units so the dependencies can be eliminated.
- Two types of unit testing
	- Manual
	- Automated
