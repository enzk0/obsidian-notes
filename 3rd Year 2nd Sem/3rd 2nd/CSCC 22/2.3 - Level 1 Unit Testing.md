# Unit Testing
---
- Unit Testing is also known as *Component Testing*
- It is a level of software testing where it tests individual components validating their performance as designed
- In procedural programming, a unit may be a individual program, function, procedure, etc.
- In object-oriented programming, a unit may be a method, that belongs to a super class, abstract class, or child class.

### Method
---
Unit Testing is usually performed with *White Box* testing and is normally automated

### Tasks
---
- Unit Test Plan [Prepare >> Review >> Rework >> Baseline]
- Unit Test Cases/ Test Scripts/ Test Data [Prepare >> Review >> Rework >> Baseline]
- Unit Test [Execute >> Re-execute]

#### When is it performed?
---
- Prior to Integration Testing
- After Coding
- Automated unit tests before coding

#### Who performs it?
---
- normally the software developers themselves or their peers
- independent software testers, rarely, but needs understanding of the code and its architecture and design

### How to do Unit Testing
---
- Developers write a section of code to test a specific function in software application. Isolate this function to test it more rigorously which reveals unnecessary dependencies between the function being tested and other units so the dependencies can be eliminated.
- Two types of unit testing
	- Manual
	- Automated

**Under the Automated Approach**
- Developer writes code to test a function. Removes it later when the app is fully deployed
- Developer could also isolate the code to help in revealing unnecessary dependencies between the code being tested and other units or data spaces. And remove these dependencies.
- Developer uses a framework to develop automated test cases.
- **Workflow**
	1. Create Test Cases
	2. Review/Rework
	3. Baseline
	4. Execute Test Cases

### Unit Testing Techniques
---
Mainly categorized into three parts:
1. Black Box Testing, testing user interface with input and output
2. White Box Testing, testing the functional behavior of the software application
3. Gray Box Testing, testing test suites, test methods, test cases, and performing risk analysis

**Code Coverage Techniques used in Unit Testing**
- Statement Coverage
- Decision Coverage
- Branch Coverage
- Condition Coverage
- Finite State Machine Coverage

### Unit Test Example: Mock Objects
---
- Unit Testing relies on mock objects that are created to test sections of code that are not yet part of the complete application
- Mock objects, fill in for the missing parts of the program.

### Unit Testing Tools

| Testing Tools |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ***Junit***   | Free to use - For Java language - Provides Assertion to identify test method - Test data first and then inserted in the piece of code.                                                                                          |
| ***NUnit***   | Widely used unit-testing framework - .NET languages - open source - allows writing scripts manually - Supports parallel data-driven tests.                                                                                      |

| ***EMMA***    | Open-source toolkit for analyzing and reporting code written in Java language. Support coverage types like method, line, basic block. Java-based so it is without external library dependencies and can access the source code. |
| ***PHPUnit*** | PHP language testing tool - takes units and test them separately - allows to use pre-define assertion methods to assert that a system behave in a certain manner.                                                               |

## White Box Testing
---
- White Box Testing is also known as Clear Box Testing, Open Box Testing, Glass Box Testing, Transparent Box Testing, Code-Based Testing or Structural Testing.
- White Box Testing is a method in which the internal structure/design/implementation of the item being tested is known to the tester.
- A way of testing the external functionality of the code by examining and testing the program code that realizes the external functionality
- A methodology to design the test cases that uses control structure of the application to test design test cases.
- White-box testing is used to test the program code, code structure, and the internal design flow.


| **ISTQB Definition**                  |                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ***White-box Testing***               | Testing based on an analysis of the internal structure of the component or system                                    |
| ***White-box Test Design Techinque*** | Procedure to derive and/or select test cases based on an analysis of the internal structure of a component or system |

### Elaboration
---
White box testing:
- the tester chooses inputs to exercise paths through the code and determines the appropriate outputs.
- Programming know-how and the implementation knowledge is essential
- Tests beyond the user interface and into the nitty-gritty of a system
- In the eyes of the tester, is like a white/transparent box.

### Levels
---
White Box Testing is applicable to:
- Unit Testing: for testing paths within a unit
- Integration Testing: for testing paths between units
- System Testing: for testing paths between subsystems


| **Advantages**                               | **Disadvantages**                                                                                                                 |
| -------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Testing can be commenced at an earlier stage | Tests can be very complex, high skilled resources are needed, with a thorough knowledge of programming and implementation         |
| Testing is more thorough, covering all paths | Test script maintenance can be a burden if the implementation changes too frequently.                                             |
|                                              | Method of testing is too close to the application, thus tools to cater every kind of platform/implementation may not be available |

### Static vs Dynamic White Box Testing
---
- ***Static Testing***, a type of testing in which the program source code is tested without running it. Only needs to examine and review the code. Finds out whether:
	- Code works according to the functional requirements
	- Code is written in accordance with the design developed earlier
	- Code for any functionality has been missed
	- Code handles error properly

- ***Dynamix Testing***, a type of testing in which the program source code is tested while executing. Executing binaries and executables are desired.

### Code Coverage Testing
---
- Code coverage testing involves designing and executing test cases and finds out the percentage of code that is covered by testing.
- Uses a technique called *instrumentation of code*, these tools:
	- rebuild the code
	- do product linking with a set of libraries provided by the tool
	- monitor the portions of code covered
	- report on the portions of the code that are covered frequently, so that the critical or most used portions of code can be identified

#### Statement coverage
---
- ***Statement coverage*** refers to writing test cases that execute each of the program statements. We assume that the more the code is covered, the better the testing of the functionality.

#### Path Coverage
---
- In the ***path coverage*** technique, we split a program into a number of distinct paths. A program or a part of a program can start from the beginning and take any of the paths to its completion. ***Path coverage*** provides a stronger condition of coverage than statement coverage as it relates to the various logical paths in the program rather than just program statements.

#### Conditional Coverage
---
- ***Condition coverage*** or ***predicate monitors*** whether every operand in a complex logical expression has taken on every TRUE/FALSE value. As path testing is not sufficient as it does not exercise each part of the Boolean expressions, relational expressions, and so on.

#### Function Coverage
---
- ***Function Coverage*** involves identifying how many program functions are covered by test cases

### Black Box and White Box Comparison

|Criteria|Black Box Testing|White Box Testing|
|---|---|---|
|_Definition_|Black Box Testing is a software testing method in which the internal structure/ design/ implementation of the item being tested _is NOT known_ to the tester.|White Box Testing is a software testing method in which the internal structure/ design/ implementation of the item being tested _is known_ to the tester.|

## Black Box Testing
---
- ***Black Box Testing***, also known as ***Behavioral Testing***  is a software testing method in which the internal structure/design/implementation of the item being tested is **not** known to the tester.

**ISTQB Definition**
- **black box testing:** Testing, either functional or non-functional, without reference to the internal structure of the component or system.
- **black box test design technique:** Procedure to derive and/or select test cases based on an analysis of the specification, either functional or non-functional, of a component or system without reference to its internal structure.

### Elaboration
- In the eyes of the tester, is like a black box, in which we cannot see what's inside. Black Box Testing attempts to find:
	- Incorrect or missing functions
	- Interface errors
	- Errors in data structures or external database access
	- Behavior or performance errors
	- Initialization and termination errors

### Levels
---
Black box testing is applicable to:
- Integration Testing
- System Testing 
- Acceptance Testing

| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ***Equivalence Partitioning*** | Divides input values into valid and invalid partitions and selecting representative values from each partition as test data                       |
| ***Boundary value Analysis***  | Determines the boundaries for input values and selecting values that are at the boundaries and just inside/outside of the boundaries as test data |
| ***Cause-Effect Graphing***    | Identifies the cases and effects, producing a cause-effect graph and generating test cases accordingly                                            |

| **Advantages**                                                                        | **Disadvantages**                                                               |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Tests are in user's POV and will help in exposing discrepancies in the specifications | Small number of possible inputs can be tested, many paths will be left untested |
| Tester does not need to know programming language or the implementation               | Without clear specifications, test cases will be difficult to design            |
| Avoids developer bias since tests can be done independently                           | Tests can be redundant                                                          |
| Test cases can be designed as soon as the specifications are complete                 |                                                                                 |

## Gray Box Testing
---
- ***Gray Box Testing***, a software testing method which is a combination of both Black box and White box testing. 
- The internal structure is partially known

### Elaboration
---
Gray Box Testing
- has access to internal data structures and algorithms for purposes of designing the test cases
- but testing is like black box

### Levels
---
Can be used in other levels, but primarily on **Integration Testing**
