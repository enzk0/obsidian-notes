## Objections
---
Objection 1. Whoever does not choose the best is lacking in power, or in knowledge, or in goodness
- We cannot always choose the best choice as their are cases where we can only choose between two goods or two evils.

Objection 2. If there is more evil than good in intelligent creatures, then there is more evil than good in the whole work of God.
- It is really not necessary that there would be more evil than good.
