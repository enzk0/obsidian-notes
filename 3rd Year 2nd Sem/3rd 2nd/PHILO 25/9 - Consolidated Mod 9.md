# Topic - Conceptions of The Self

- This  topic explores how people can understand who they are and what is their purpose.
- In Western thought, the self is often seen as a separate, independent individual. 
- In contrast, Eastern traditions like Buddhism and Hinduism view the self as deeply connected to others or as something to be transcended. 
- These differing views shape how people think about identity, purpose, and personal growth. Studying them helps us appreciate the rich variety of human thought and experience.

#### 4 Major Conceptions of the Self

| Conceptions                      | Definitions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Dualism                          | a person consists of two substances: a material substance (the body) and an immaterial or mental substance (the soul or mind).                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Materialism                      | An idea that there is no immaterial aspect of the self â€“ no soul or immaterial mind.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Monotheistic Pantheism           | Sees the individual self as ultimately illusory. The true self (Atman) is identical with Brahman, the undivided Ultimate Reality. After death, the cycle of reincarnation continues until enlightenment (moksha) is reached and the illusion of separateness dissolves.                                               |
| Buddhist Doctrine of the No-Self | Rejects the notion of a permanent or substantial self. Instead, the self is seen as a changing stream of experiences. Rebirth occurs not through the transmigration of a soul but as a causal continuation of consciousness shaped by karma. Liberation (nirvana) is achieved when the truth of non-self is realized. |

#### Human Freedom
---
*Do we truly possess free will?*
- We doe since we have experiences of making choices.
- But there is the idea of predestination that questions if we actually have free will.

**Divine Predestination**
- It is where all our actions are already predetermined by God and this makes us have no freedom at all.
	- So this shifted to **Divine** **Foreknowledge** instead, where:
		- Where God knows what will happen, yet does not cause it
		- Where God's knowledge is like perfect foresight, but not manipulation

#### Life and Death
---
***Reincarnation***
- The belief that after death, the conscious self is reborn in a new body-human or animal
- Some people can even remember their past lives as they claimed

***Karma***
 - The belief that actions can have good consequences or bad consequences that affect the current life or the future lives

#### Arguments for Immortality
---
***Mind-Body Dependency***
- Consciousness appears to rely on the brain, raising questions about its fate after death

***Personal Identity***
- It's unclear what preserves a person's unique self without a body

***Desirability of Eternity***
- Arguments that the eternal existence could lead to boredom or loss of meaning

# My Insights
---
Even though I still do not have truly found my true belonging and purpose in the world, this topic just gave me some knowledge on what to do with myself. I always like to wonder and I'm kind of in terms with the concept of Dualism. Dualism where there is both body and soul and that the soul can arrive to anything respective of the belief that you follow in. I want to think that there would be reincarnation that would happen, as I like stories and comics where reincarnation and soul traveling to another world is on the trends. So ill just still do my part as a student, as being a 3rd year is a stress, and ill just worry later in life about what my purpose would be. It may take me years but who knows. Ill just stay true and authentic to myself so that I would not have any regrets in my choices.
