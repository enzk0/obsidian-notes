Classical argument from design: 

Cleanthes: "Look round the world: Contemplate the whole and every part of it: You will find it to be nothing but one great machine, subdivided into an infinite number of lesser machines, which again admit of subdivisions, to a degree beyond what human senses and faculties can trace and explain. All these various machines, and even their most minute parts, are adjusted to each other with an accuracy, which ravishes into admiration all men, who have ever contemplated them. The curious adapting of means to ends, throughout all nature, resembles exactly, though it much exceeds, the productions of human contrivance; of human design, thought, wisdom, and intelligence. Since therefore the effects resemble each other, we are led to infer, by all the rules of analogy, that the causes also resemble; and that the author of nature is somewhat similar to the mind of man; though possessed of much larger faculties, proportioned to the grandeur of the work, which he has executed. By this argument a posteriori, and by this argument alone, do we prove at once the existence of a deity, and his similarity to human mind and intelligence."

## Hume’s critique:
● We do not know what is most typical in the structure of the world hence we do not know which of the possible analogies to prefer.
● Because we technologically organize matter by the use of our intelligence and skill is no reason to suppose that all organization has mind as its cause. All such arguments end in anthropomorphism.
● The anthropomorphic conception of deity does not explain anything finally; it rather leads us into an infinite regress. “What caused it?”
● We have no right to assume as a cause of the world
order a mind which in this respect is wholly unlike the
only minds we know.
● We have spoken of the so-called natural attributes of God, those by which He is supposed to be the author of the physical order. But what about the moral order, or
the order of values?
● The conception of God as a perfect being has not been proved and we have no reason to think that this world could not have been created except by a perfect being, because we do not know that this is the best of all possible worlds.

## Hume’s final verdict on the argument from design:
● The world arose from something like design, that the designer may have some remote resemblance to the human mind, but that he resembles man intellectually more than morally.
● This inference does not have the certitude that the religious person claims for his beliefs.

## Hume on religion
● Proper attitude is one of cool reserve, of cautiously fitting his beliefs to the narrow shape of the evidence, of not trying to squeeze more out of the evidence than can be honestly got.
● The only honest attitude for the Christian, therefore, is one of faith, not one of claim ing to base orthodox belief upon reason. This does not mean that Hume favors faith above reason; it means only that if you insist upon being religious, you cannot appeal to reason to backup your faith.
