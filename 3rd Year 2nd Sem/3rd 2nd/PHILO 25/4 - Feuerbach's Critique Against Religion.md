## Ludwig Andreas von Feuerbach
---
- German anthropologist and philosopher
- Raised protestant and religiously devout in his youth
- advocated *atheism* and *anthropological materialism*
- Author of The Essence of Christianity

*"Every aspect we speak of God is an attribute that we find in man. No concept in religion in this sense comes from a transcendental source. Religion simply manifests what man is in terms of his less than ideal nature."*

## The Role of Consciousness
---
- In *epistemology*, the *perceptions o the senses consciousness of the object (object)* is distinguishable from *consciousness of the self (subject)*
- In religion, consciousness of the object and self-consciousness coincide. 
- *The object of the senses is out of man, the religious object is within him.*

### Feuerbach's Proposition
---
- The object of any subject is nothing else than the subjectâ€™s own nature taken objectively.
	- What we see in objects are what we see in ourself objectively?

## Religion and Man's Consciousness
---
- Religion is the relation of man to *himself*
- The divine being is just the human being or the purified nature of human whose freed from human limits made objective
- Thus, all attributes of divine nature are also attributes of human nature

### Religion and Man'/God's Nature
---
- The qualities of God just mirrors the understanding of man to himself
- A being without qualities cannot become an object to the mind and is virtually non-existent
- The theory that God *cannot be defined*, and *consequently cannot be known by man*, is therefore the offspring of recent times, a ***product of modern unbelief***
- If man loses interest in religion, religion becomes insipid and so does the existence of God
- Thus, it is necessary to have a definite conception of God even though God's attributes are finite and human
