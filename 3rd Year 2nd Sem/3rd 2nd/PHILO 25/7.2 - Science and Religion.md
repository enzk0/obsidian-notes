---
- Sam Harris emphasized historical atrocities made by religions across various faiths
- For him, religion is irrational and dangerous
	- As it relies on blind faith which can make people do things beyond reason such as doing violence and terrorism
- His solution to this is to replace religious faith with reason.

### Religion and Science

###### Conflict

| ***Scriptural Literalists***                                                                                                                                                    | ***Scientific Materialism***                                                                                                                                                                                |

| These people believe that sacred texts give a literal and historically accurate explanation of the world and its origins. These texts are seen as the ultimate source of truth. | These people believe that only the material world exists and that explanation and knowledge can only be gained through observation and experimentation. They reject any spiritual or religious explanations |
***Scientific Materialism (Scientism)***
- Knowledge can only be gained through anything observable and testable
- Limits knowledge by not accepting others aside from the first point.
- Close minded

***Theological Criticism of Literal Interpretation***
- Theologians argue that the sacred texts and scriptures should not be read like a science textbook
- Sacred texts are misunderstood as the one giving factual information about nature and provide literal explanations

###### Independence
---
- This is where Science and Religion are separated
	1. Scriptures
		- provides human attempts in encountering the divine
		- gives religious insights, by the movement of the spirit
	2. Science
		- offers information about the empirical world
- Both deal with complete different aims, subjects, goals, and methods

Challenges for this
- human experience is holistic and not separate like science and religion
- life is interconnected


###### Integration Model
---
- This is where science and religions are tried to have a harmonious relationship
- Integration seeks to respect both fields
- They are not to be merged but to complement one another

Through ***Natural Theology***
- attempts to infer Godâ€™s existence through evidence found in nature.
- new discoveries in the fields of Science make new arguments for the existence of God
- Both may have different perspectives and methods, but both point towards the same truth

Through ***Process Philosophy***
- seeks to merge both science and religion, a metaphysical system
- incorporates modern scientific ideas like relativity and evolution.
- GOD IS VIEWED AS DIPOLAR: 
	- Primordial Nature: Ordering the world. 
	- Consequent Nature: Interacting with and changing alongside the world.

### Religious Belief and Justification

| ***Two Perspectives***   |                                          |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Non-Evidential Faith** | Belief with no proof or evidence         |
| **Rational Validation**  | Beliefs supported by reason and evidence |


| ***Epistemological Approach to Faith*** |                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Rational validation**                 | - Beliefs are supported with evidence and reason                                                                                                                                        |
| **Non-evidentialism**                   | - Beliefs are rational even without evidence and reason                                                                                                                                 |
| **Fideism**                             | - Faith is independent of reason<br>- Example is Kierkegaard whom highlights passionate and subjective commitment of faith rather than rational justification                           |
| **Reformed Epistemology**               | - By Alvin Platinga<br>- It is about beliefs of God can be basic, accepted without proof. Like daritso<br>- Some beliefs can be rational if they came from reliable cognitive faculties |
| **Will to Believe**                     | - In genuine, forced, and momentous choice experiences, that leads to transformative changes. Belief on God can be rational without sufficient evidefnce                                |
