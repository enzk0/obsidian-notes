*"How can we rationalize on whether God exist?"*

## Ontological Argument
---

### Anselm of Canterbury
---
- *Benedictine Monk and Archbishop*, Christian Philosopher, and Theologian.
- Originator of **Ontological Argument**
	- *Medieval Period*: Contemplated on whether God exists or not.
	- Philosophy was the *handmaid of Theology*. Philo helped Theo.

#### Idea of God
> *Id quo maius cogitari nequit*:  that than which nothing greater can be thought of
- the greatest conceivable being
*For God must be God he must not be bested by other existence*
- this is the common understanding of God

#### Modal Logic
- **modal**: an expression used to qualify the *truth of a judgment*. A *study of deductive behavior* of the expressions *'it is necessary that'* and *'it is possible that'*.

### Ontological Argument
---
- attempts to *infer on God's existence* with *not proving or not relying* on the *observation of the world*
- •Starts with the nature of the concept of God to the conclusion that God in fact exists
- this argument is a **priori** (independent of experience, prior to experience)

#### Reductio ad absurdum argument
- is a **process of refutation** on grounds that *absurd – and patently untenable consequences* would *ensue from accepting the item at issue*. This takes three principal forms according as that untenable consequence is: a **self-contradiction** (ad absurdum), a **falsehood** (ad falsum or even ad impossible), an **implausibility or anomaly** (ad ridiculum or ad incommodum)

### Anselm's Ontological Argument
---
1. God exist in the understanding
	- focuses not on the term "God" but the **idea** of it
	- the idea of greatest conceivable being qualifies "God"
	*"Unsay fool?"*
	*"Swimming Fool!" - Cathy*
	- A **fool** is someone who can think of God but does not understand it.
	- As God *exists in the mind*, then God also *exists in reality*
2. God is a possible being
3. What exists in the mind, and does exists in reality. Then that must be the greatest.
4. Supposed God exists only in the understanding (reductio fallacy)…
5. Then, God might have been greater than he actually is.
6. God is a being than which a greater is possible.
7. The being which no greater is possible is a being than which a greater is possible
8. It must be false that God exists only in the understanding
9. Therefore, God exists in reality as well as the understanding

### Gaunilo's Objection to Anselm
---
- ***Gaunilo of Marmoutiers***

**Lost Island Objection**
	If I can think of a perfect island, then that must exist in reality
	***Absurd Conclusion***

**Anselm's Response**
	1. God is a unique and necessary being, unlike other contingent concepts.
	*"For a perfect island to exist, it must come from other beings. Different from God who is necessary and great, thus comparing a perfect island to God whom is a greater being, is a bad analogy"*
	2. Very nature of God entails existence.
	3. God's greatness and necessary existence set him apart from other conceivable perfections or concepts.

## Cosmological and Teleological Argument
---
**Cosmological** - something that is observable in the real world
- *kosmos*: world
- *-logia*: discourse or "treating of"
**Teleological** - end or purpose
- *telos*: end or purpose

### Thomas Aquinas
---
- Italian Catholic Christian
- Fond in the writings of Aristotle
- Lived in the medieval period
- cosmological and teleological

#### Summa Theologiae
- Compendium of theology
- was an unfinished book due to the reasoning that "For I am writing someone greater, I could not possibly define it?"

### The Five Proofs
#### 1 Motion
---
First Proof, *cosmological*: 
- Changing *potentiality* to *actuality*
- Motion allows us to grasp its existence
- *God is the **Prime Mover***

#### 2 Cause and Effect
---
Second Proof, *cosmological*: 
- Everything in reality is *caused* by something else
- **Causation** relationship between cause and effect, *cause brings effect*
- If there would be many "causes", it would ruin the process in the long run
- *God is the **Uncaused** **Cause***

#### 3 Possibility and Necessity
---
Third Proof, *cosmological*: 
- Everything needs something to exist, thus *Contingent Beings*
> **contingency** - somethings needs something to exist
> **necessary** - something that exists on its own
- *God is the **Necessary Being** (self-existence)*

#### 4 Gradation of Perfection
---
Fourth Proof, *cosmological*: 
- Our existence is limited
- Everything has more or less
	- flicker -> burn -> flame -> fire
- **Gradation**: varying degrees of qualities of existence, signifying that there must be a perfect one
- *God is the **Perfect Being***

#### 5 Governance of the Things
---
Fifth Proof, *teleological*:
- everything has order and purpose
- design with complexity and order suggests that there must be a designer
- What ever lacks knowledge cannot move towards and end
- *God is the **Intelligent Designer***

### Objections on Aquinas' Proofs
---
1. Relies on *metaphysical concepts*, going beyond physical, that they might **not be true** in *modern philosophy and science*.  
2. Why the 1st Cause exempted to the "causation chain". As God is self-existent, so what causes this attribute?
3. Aquinas' Proofs might not be accurate to the metaphysical realm.
4. Aquinas' Proofs lack empirical evidence, mostly abstract philosophical reasoning.
5. Aquinas' Proofs are shaped by his religious and cultural context, biased.
6. Aquinas' Proofs has a monotheistic perspective, but his proofs could be used to support existence of multiple gods.

## Classical Design Argument
---
### William Paley
---
- English Angelican priest, theologian, moral philosopher
- A writer on Christianity, ethics, and science
- Has own standard exposition in English theology of the teleological argument for the existence of God

### Classical Design Argument
---
- teleological argument
	- *"end or purpose"*
- from the book natural theology in 1802
	- **analogical argument**

#### Main Arguments
---
- **Introduction**
	- analogy between a watch and the natural world.
	- stumbles (experiences) upon a watch (universe) leads to a conclusion that there is a watchmaker that determines the parts and design
- **Complexity and Design**
	- complexity and design of evident on *existing beings*, and to an unbiased person
- **Variety and Functionality**
	- variety of lifeforms, adapting to its environment
	- gives of an idea that *intentional design* is present, rather it being a chance
- **Adaptation and Purpose**
	- design is intended to *fulfill a particular function*
	- even the intricate parts, signifying that there is an intelligent creator
- **Interdependence and Chance**
	- there is independency of parts
	- but ***"chance"*** will not produce such *order and purpose given the consistency*, even *replication*.

#### Watchmaker Arguments
---
1. We did not see the making of the watch, but it does not mean that there is no watchmaker.
	- if there is a watch, there is watchmaker. if there is a world, there is a world maker.
2. If the watch has a problem or not, there is still design
3. If there are parts that we cannot understand nor control, does not mean that there is no intention and connection that points that there is no contrivance present.
	- **contrivance** - made with complexity and skill. 
4. A watch is not made randomly by combining material things, it signifies that there is a designer or maker, a person who believes it to be chance is absurd
5. A principle of order cannot explain enough the intricate design. Thus a person will not be satisfied with that reason. Only the intelligent maker or designer could truly explain it.
6. It is surprising of us that we are amazed that the watch is made of contrivance, but only a motive to induce the mind to think so.
7. It is surprising that the watch exist just because it is an order or law of metallic nature. It needs power for this to act. Needs reason.
8. There are things that we know even if we cannot perceive it, but it does not invalidate what we know or its truthfulness.
*"The consciousness of knowing little, need not beget a distrust of that which he does know."*
