# Topic  - Religion in Context of Globalization
### Modern Religious Landscape
---
- **Globalization**, has paved the way for many religious diversities and traditions. More than that encounters with people from different traditions and belief are highly possible
	- Now people are now exposed to more different points of views and that this may lead to a harmonious result or maybe conflict instead

#### Major World Religions
---
***Hinduism***
- Considered as the oldest living religion originated from the Indian subcontinent.
- The ultimate goal is moksha, release from the cycle of death and rebirth (samsara) and absorption into Brahman. This is achievable through the paths (margas) of knowledge (jnanamarga), devotion (bhaktimarga), or action (karmamarga)

***Buddhism***
- This religion is founded by Siddhartha Gautama, the Buddha, in the 5th century BCE
- This denies the existence of a permanent soul and follows the Four Noble Truths which are:
	1. Existence is suffering
	2. Suffering is caused by desire
	3. Suffering can be ended
	4. Achieve Nirvana to end suffering and practicing the Eightfold Path

***Judaism***
- The religion's goal is to be blessed with God, here and perhaps in the hereafter which can be accomplished by completing the divine commandments
- The central God is Yaweh

***Christianity***
- This religion is based on the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ who is believed to be the sun of God
- The main scripture is the Bible
- Believers of this religion constantly participate in the Church

***Islam***
- This religion is founded by the Prophet Muhammad during the 7th-century Arabia
- Their God is Allah
- Islam means submission to God's will
- Qur'an is their main scripture

| Atheism                | Denies religions, claiming that they are false and that no religion's claims are true                               |
| Agnosticism            | In the position where there is no way to identify if any religions are most likely true. Remains agnostic           |
| Religious Relativism   | Each religion are considered true for its followers. Respects the diverse experiences and claims of other religions |
| Religious Pluralism    | All religions are true and that the all lead, may it be partially, to the ultimate truth                            |
| Religious Incluvism    | One religions is fully true and that other religions help in revealing the truth                                    |

| Religious Subjectivism | Each religion is correct, and they are correct as far as for the people who believe in it                           |

### Criteria for Evaluating Religious System

| Criterions                                        |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Social Consistency                                | - Fundamental Propositions should not contradict with each other.<br>- Religions can generally make their claims about the reality, self, and goals<br>- These claims cannot contradict one another as it makes them not true.            |
| Coherence of the System                           | - Fundamental claims must be related to one another and offer a unified understanding of the world and the individual's place in it                                                                                                       |
| Consistency with other Fields                     | - Fundamental claims must not contradict on the well-established knowledge in other fields such as science, history, psychology, and archeology<br>- If claims contradict with the established fields, the religions must be re-evaluated |
| Reasonable Answers to Fundamental Human Questions | - Religion must be able to answer fundamental human questions:<br>     - Who am I?<br>	 - Why am I here?<br>	 - The Nature of Reality<br>	 - The Problem of Human Condition<br>	 - Afterlife                                              |
| Existential Plausibility                          | - People must be able to live based on the fundamental beliefs of the religion.<br>- These beliefs must not be borrowed from an other religion                                                                                            |
# My Insights
---
Now this is the topic that strike me hard the most, and where I really get to learn on what I feel about religion right now and in my place of understanding. As before, I always use the word Atheism whenever someone asks me about what religion I believe in. But I truly did misunderstand the meaning of Atheism as these kinds of people truly reject and deny any religion at all. The right word that I should use was that I am "Agnostic", as I somehow kind of understand other people belief but I also don't kind of believe on what they preach. I'm more into terms with distancing myself with religion but not in a way that I would deny or reject them. By doing this, I think that I could navigate myself through the various religions and beliefs this world has to offer, and it truly keeps me being an open-minded person.
