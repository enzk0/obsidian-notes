- **Religion** raises profound questions and provokes the believer to seek *deeper understanding*.

	- ***"Cui bono?"*** - to who is it good?

- Focuses on the religions' **function** in the *culture*.
- **Religion** is *cultural* or a part of it.

### The Roots of Religion

- Tendency to **adding agency** to *complicated animate objects*.
- Thus, it **backfires** as this would be our *usual response to life*

### Religion, the Early Days
---
- An *unexplainable event happens*, **assigns** it to an *agent with thoughts and feelings*
- **Beliefs** is passed from *generation to generation*. A role of elders.
- **Fear of accountability** to freedom and actions. Kind of a "Bahala na" attitude

### The Evolution of Stewardship

#### Others
- People, not doing any **verification** of claims and *just believes through it*
- **Religion** is *good for one's health* but **not** a good basis for *morality*
