## Human Experience on Evil
---
- Mainly that people are ***suffering***
- For a long time or rather centuries, people have been experience pain and suffering as they are *stuck* with *hope of peace*, *prosperity*, and *eradicating evil*.

## The Tensions Between Divine Attributes
---
- God is *all powerful*, *all knowing*, and *perfectly good*. Yet, ***Evil Exists***
- Despite being omnipotent, omnipresent, and omnibenevolent. People still experience pain and suffering, the evil is present.

**Defense of Theism**
- The defense then of Theism is that people have ***free-will***.
	- Thus, it is logically impossible for God to create free creatures but limit them on not doing evil. In a sense, limiting them is not free at all.
- Free-will for Moral Evil
	- God finds freedom so inherently good or great such that, even if freedom may cause evil, it is justifiable for God to allow the existence of freedom
- Justification of Natural Evil
	- A first argument that it was the work of the devil and his angels
	- Another is that it is a part of the physical laws necessary for consistent balancing action where humanity is held accountable for their free-will

| Classifications | Description                                                                                                                                                                   |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Natural Evil    | Where evil comes from natural phenomena and that it was not brought about by the free will of a moral agent.                                                                  |
| Moral Evil      | Where it now comes from the moral agent towards their muses of his/her free will.                                                                                             |
| Gratuitous Evil | An evil where an experience makes no sense or no point in its presence or existence                                                                                           |
| Horrendous Evil | It is where the experiences of the victim gives enough reason and justification to doubt that the victim's life could be taken to be a great good to the victim on the whole. |

***Approaching the Problem of Evil***
1. **Defense**
	- Simply a demonstration of consistency where it is an effort to show that there is no formal contradiction given the premises.
2. **Theodicy**
	- A theory whose claim is to explain why God in fact permits evil but not provide a solution to the problem of evil.
