# Topic - Idea of Holy
---
#### Rudolf Otto
---
- Rudolf Otto was a German theologian and philosopher of religion.
- He is known for the "The Idea of the Holy".

### Otto: Rationality and Religion
---
- Religion has rational concepts of God, but the divine also has a suprarational aspect that goes beyond reason.

**Limitations of Rationality**
- Rational concepts define God, but it does not explain the divine fully.

**Over-Rationalizing God**
- Extreme emphasis of reason in religion creates false narratives that God is understandable.
- There is more to divine that what we can logically define.

**Mysticism**
- This concept acknowledges that the divine is beyond full human comprehension
- *Mystics*, seeks to express the inexpressible through symbols and their personal experiences

**The Importance of the Non-Rational in Theology**
- Too much over emphasizing neglects the unique and experiential aspects of religion
- True religion includes mystery and awe that go beyond ideas and doctrines, which rational analysis alone cannot fully grasp.

### Numen and Numinous
---
**Numen**
- comes from Latin word "divine will" or "a god's presence"
- It describes an intriguing divine force or presence. Something that is felt and experienced.

**Numinous**
- the sensation or experience where one encounters the numen
- According to Otto, it is a profound, overwhelming, and mysterious feeling that evokes both wonder and awe.

### Characteristics of the Numinous
---
**Mysterium**
- Refers to the fact that numinous is beyond human understanding
- It can't be described well in logical terms

**Tremendum**
- Part of the numinous is the sense of fear and overwhelming power.
- But instead of an ordinary fear, it is a feeling of awe and reverence before something vast and beyond human control.

**Fascinians**
- The feeling that draws people toward the divine despite mystery and power
- It is why people feel a sense of peace, curiosity, or longing in the presence of something sacred.

### Holiness and Holy, Sui Generis
---
- Holiness is often linked to moral purity, goodness, or religious devotion
	- But Otto argues that is much more. Like a special experience, a deep sense of being in the presence of something divine
	- Otto says that the numinous experience cannot be fully explained in words because it is not a rational idea—it is something you feel deeply.

- Sui generis, a Latin phrase of "unique" or "one of a kind"
	- Otto says that experience of holiness is sui generis, completely different from any other human experience
	- Otto says that true holiness is a state of mind that comes from experiencing the numinous

### Creature Feeling
---
**Creature Feeling**, explained by Otto as when a human experience the numinous and they would feel like small and powerless creatures in the presence of something infinitely greater. But it is feeling of humility, awe, and a deep awareness of our own limitations

**Creature Consciousness**, it is the realization of one's own insignificance compared to the supreme divine power.

### Mysterium Tremendum
---
**Mysterium Tremendum**, refers to the deep, overwhelming feeling people experience when they encounter the divine
- **Mysterium (mystery)**, the divine is beyond human understanding
- **Tremendum (Terror)**, fear, awe, and a sense of one's smallness when something greater is in front.

##### Main Elements of Mysterium Tremendum
**Element of Awefulness**
- Special kind of fear or dread, different from ordinary fear.

**Element of Overpoweringness**
- Absolute unapproachability combined with might and power.

**Element of Energy**
- The vitality, passion, force, activity, and dynamism of the numinous object.

The feeling of Tremendum is a mix of: ***Awe/Dread + Overpowering Majesty + Dynamic Energy***. Otto asserts that this non-rational core must remain central to avoid reducing religion to mere ethics or rational theology.


# Topic - Eliade's The Sacred and the Profane
---
### Mircea Eliade
---
- He is a prominent figure of religious studies and comparative religion
- His main contributions are in the understanding of religious symbolism, mythology, and the sacred

## Sacred Space and Making the World Sacred
---
**Sacred Space**
- a place where it is apart from the ordinary world, believed to hold special significance or power
- a place where the transcendent is believed to manifest in a unique way
- religious rituals, ceremonies, and encounters on the sacred

**Profane Space**
- the ordinary, everyday environment
- lacks special significance or power
- the secular world
- common places

# Topic - Miracles and the Modern Worldview
---
## Miracles: Incompatible with a Scientific World View?
---
*“Miracles belong to a pre scientific picture of the world in which supernatural beings invade the natural world and bring about extraordinary events: raising from the dead or turning water into wine.”* 
- By Rudolf Bultmann

**Modern World View**
- raised by Science and Technology
- views nature as a closed, autonomous realm where an event of nature comes from another event of nature
- this made people no longer believe in miraculous stories
- leaves little or no room for spirits and miracles
- Modern people like to accept explanation that is clear and concise

## Hume's Definition of Miracles
---
**Miracle's Meaning: Two Senses**
- Popular
	- A miracle is unexpected yet beneficial event
- Strict
	- A miracle is an event that satisfies two distinct conditions
		- Nature cannot produce the event
		- An event that is directly intervened by God or some supernatural agent

**Miracle**
- an event not following a law that is made by a deity or some supernatural agent

*“A miracle may either be discoverable by men or not. This alters not its nature and essence. The raising of a house or ship into the air is a visible miracle. The raising of a feather, when the wind wants ever so little of a force requisite to that purpose, is as real a miracle, though not so sensible with regard to us. ”*
- By Hume's Reply

**Objection to Hume's Definition of Miracle**
There are conditions that are not sufficient and not necessary for something being a miracle. In where:
- A miracle is a surprising, astounding event. 
- A miracle serves some important, beneficial purpose.

*"Something may be a miracle even though we are unable to recognize it as such. Being astounding or surprising may be a condition if we are to believe that it is a miracle, not a condition to must be satisfied to be a miracle. Conditions 3 and 4 are necessary for visible miracles not to the invisible ones.*

*In different train example, supposed there is a child who are about to be hit by a train but the train engineer fainted on natural cause had his hand ceases to exert pressure on the control lever bringing the train to halt a few feet from the child. Is it not a miracle? Where is God's intervention?*

*The mother of the child proclaiming it a miracle would say that the timing of the natural causes of fainting was in some way due to God’s intervention. If it happened later may not save the child"*
- Hume's Reply

**For Hume, Miracles are:**
- our inability to understand the laws of nature
- our natural tendency to believe in extraordinary happenings
- evidence can only be found by witnesses' testimony

**Miracles Explanation: Floating Object**
- Accordance with a principle
- Refutation of a principle
- Violation of the law of nature

If someone already believes in a providential God who can intervene in the world, then accepting the possibility of miracles becomes more rational.

# My Insights
---
The topic that I find most interesting in this file is Otto's Idea of Holy. Lately I've been feeling that I kind of do not believe in God anymore as a Christian, or rather, I find the rituals such as going to church or even praying as like a chore. So right now, I'm kind of like agnostic in my point of view in religion. And in my insight, I will take on a position as of an in-between as believer and agnosticism, as I still find it hard to harden my beliefs.

I like Otto's perspective of Holy, in where we explain things through wonder, and that I think is the main selling point in living, we wonder the world and find fun things to live for. Even though I'm kind of like an in between as a believer and agnostic, I did feel or experience a numinous experience. Because whenever I see something beyond me like a beautiful landscape in the mountains, I always find myself in awe and then I would wonder of "Who really made this beautiful view". And there I then instinctively think that "There might be someone greater that did it", and then I kind of feel the creature feeling.

It is also interesting to know the concept of sacred time, sacred space, and the profane. I always thought that local churches are truly the sacred, I mean it is kind of sacred as there we always perform our worship to God and hear the teachings, but what I mean is that they are the most genuinely true sacred. I only knew now that churches in example, are the copies of the sacred space and there is a true sacred space for this in which I forgot. So that is just an interesting thing to learn, and I am always up for interesting trivia and ideas.
