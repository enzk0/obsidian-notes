#### Rudolf Otto
---
- Rudolf Otto was a German theologian and philosopher of religion.
- He is known for the "The Idea of the Holy".

### Otto: Rationality and Religion
---
- Religion has rational concepts of God, but the divine also has a suprarational aspect that goes beyond reason.

**Limitations of Rationality**
- Rational concepts define God, but it does not explain the divine fully.

**Over-Rationalizing God**
- Extreme emphasis of reason in religion creates false narratives that God is understandable.
- There is more to divine that what we can logically define.

**Mysticism**
- This concept acknowledges that the divine is beyond full human comprehension
- *Mystics*, seeks to express the inexpressible through symbols and their personal experiences

**The Importance of the Non-Rational in Theology**
- Too much over emphasizing neglects the unique and experiential aspects of religion
- True religion includes mystery and awe that go beyond ideas and doctrines, which rational analysis alone cannot fully grasp.

### Numen and Numinous
---
**Numen**
- comes from Latin word "divine will" or "a god's presence"
- It describes an intriguing divine force or presence. Something that is felt and experienced.

**Numinous**
- the sensation or experience where one encounters the numen
- According to Otto, it is a profound, overwhelming, and mysterious feeling that evokes both wonder and awe.

### Characteristics of the Numinous
---
**Mysterium**
- Refers to the fact that numinous is beyond human understanding
- It can't be described well in logical terms

**Tremendum**
- Part of the numinous is the sense of fear and overwhelming power.
- But instead of an ordinary fear, it is a feeling of awe and reverence before something vast and beyond human control.

**Fascinians**
- The feeling that draws people toward the divine despite mystery and power
- It is why people feel a sense of peace, curiosity, or longing in the presence of something sacred.

### Holiness and Holy, Sui Generis
---
- Holiness is often linked to moral purity, goodness, or religious devotion
	- But Otto argues that is much more. Like a special experience, a deep sense of being in the presence of something divine
	- Otto says that the numinous experience cannot be fully explained in words because it is not a rational ideaâ€”it is something you feel deeply.

- Sui generis, a Latin phrase of "unique" or "one of a kind"
	- Otto says that experience of holiness is sui generis, completely different from any other human experience
	- Otto says that true holiness is a state of mind that comes from experiencing the numinous

### Creature Feeling
---
**Creature Feeling**, explained by Otto as when a human experience the numinous and they would feel like small and powerless creatures in the presence of something infinitely greater. But it is feeling of humility, awe, and a deep awareness of our own limitations

**Creature Consciousness**, it is the realization of one's own insignificance compared to the supreme divine power.

### Mysterium Tremendum
---
**Mysterium Tremendum**, refers to the deep, overwhelming feeling people experience when they encounter the divine
- **Mysterium (mystery)**, the divine is beyond human understanding
- **Tremendum (Terror)**, fear, awe, and a sense of one's smallness when something greater is in front.
