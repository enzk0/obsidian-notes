The Church teaches that the human person is the foundation and purpose of the political community, and that the political community creates a human environment that offers citizens the possibility of truly exercising their human rights and of fulfilling completely their corresponding duties in order to pursue the common good.

## The Political Community at the Service of Civil Society
---
**Key Concepts.** ‚ÄúThe purpose of civil society is universal, since it concerns the common good, to which each and every citizen has a right in due proportion‚Äù. This is marked by a planning capacity that aims at fostering a freer and more just social life, in which the various groups of citizens can form associations, working to develop and express their preferences, in order to meet their fundamental needs and defend their legitimate interests‚Äô

### üîπ **Main Idea**
The political community (i.e., the state or government) exists **to serve civil society**, not the other way around. Its role is to enable social groups and individuals to thrive through a just, participatory, and pluralistic society.

---
### üîπ **Key Points**
1. **Value of Civil Society**
    - Civil society includes all social, cultural, and community relationships **independent of the state and market**.
    - It reflects human relational nature and openness to the transcendent.
    - Threatened by individualistic or totalitarian ideologies that try to absorb it into the State.
2. **Priority of Civil Society**
    - Civil society is **foundational and prior** to the political community.
    - The State **derives its justification** from civil society and must serve it.
    - The State should offer legal frameworks to enable **freedom of association**.
3. **Subsidiarity**
    - The **principle of subsidiarity** means political structures should support, not replace, social initiatives.
    - Especially applies to the "third sector"‚Äî**volunteer work, cooperatives, and associations**.
    - These foster human dignity, participation, and enriched democratic life.
4. **Cooperation and Social Ethics**
    - Cooperation and solidarity **counteract individualism and competition**.
    - Volunteerism and community involvement **build public ethics and solidarity**, especially supporting the vulnerable.

---
### üîë **Key Terms**
- **Civil Society**: Sphere of free associations and social interactions beyond state and market control.
- **Political Community**: The government or state, existing to serve civil society.
- **Subsidiarity**: Principle that decisions should be made at the lowest appropriate level.
- **Third Sector**: Non-governmental, non-market initiatives (e.g., volunteerism, cooperatives).
- **Subjectivity of Society**: Civil society as an active, legitimate agent of social and moral development.

The Church teaches that the political community originates from and is established to serve the civil society. Hence, the political community must apply the principle of subsidiarity in exercising its authority.

## The State and Religious Communities
---
**Key Concepts.** The Church explains her involvement in politics, the meaning of the separation between Church and State and both collaborate with each other, the mission of the Church in the political order, the Church‚Äôs contribution in the vision of human dignity and solidarity, the relationship between the political authority and citizens, and the Church‚Äôs integrative development political affairs.

### üîπ **Main Idea**
The document asserts the **right to religious freedom** and calls for a **proper relationship between Church and State**, emphasizing mutual autonomy and the need for cooperation.

---
### üîπ **Key Points**
1. **Religious Freedom**
    - A **fundamental human right**, rooted in human dignity and the search for truth.
    - Cannot be coerced‚Äîtruth must be embraced freely.
    - Must be legally protected but has limits tied to **common good and public morality**.
2. **Legal and Social Protections**
    - States should **recognize religious freedom** in law and practice.
    - Special recognition of certain religions (due to cultural/historical reasons) is acceptable if it doesn't lead to **discrimination**.
3. **Autonomy of Church and State**
    - Church and political community are **distinct and independent**, with different missions.
    - The Church respects democratic autonomy and **does not dictate political systems** or endorse parties.
4. **Mutual Cooperation**
    - Despite their autonomy, **cooperation is encouraged** for the good of the person and society.
    - The Church can and should **speak on moral issues** affecting human rights and dignity.
5. **Church‚Äôs Rights**
    - The Church seeks freedom to carry out its mission: teaching, worship, organization, property ownership, and association.
6. **Harmonious Relations**
    - Legal frameworks and agreements should be established to **manage Church‚ÄìState relations**, avoiding both persecution and overreach.
---

### üîë **Key Terms**
- **Religious Freedom**: The right to live one‚Äôs faith publicly and privately without coercion.
- **Autonomy**: Independence of Church and State in their respective domains.
- **Moral Order**: Objective standards of right and wrong, which guide limits on freedoms.
- **Legal Recognition**: The Church‚Äôs right to be recognized as a juridical entity with its own mission and structure.
- **Cooperation**: Joint efforts for the common good without violating autonomy.

The Church claims that her involvement in politics is based on freedom of conscience and religion that ‚Äúconcerns man both individually and socially‚Äù. The Church asserts that the right to religious freedom must be recognized in the juridical order and sanctioned as a civil right; nonetheless, it is not of itself an unlimited right.‚Äô (CCSD no. 422).



The political community consists of persons, social groups and organizations, their institutions, and structures that are necessary for directing or ordering society towards the common good. The common good is the full justification, meaning, and source of the political community‚Äôs specific and basic right to exist (GS, 74). Within the political community is public or political authority which ‚Äúmust be exercised within the limits of the moral order and directed toward the common good.‚Äù
