***Marriage and family***, the very basic *legal structure* in society.

## Marriage and Family
---
- 4th commandment: ***"Honor your father and mother"***
	- It is about *respect for life*, *marriage*, *earthly goods*, and *speech that constitute the foundation of the Church social teaching*. 
	- It is the *context* of marriage and family.
- God established the family based on the *covenant* and *consent of the spouses*
	-  It is in the family where children learn moral values and are initiated into life in society
- Family as the original ***cell*** in society
	- The person and society’s wellbeing depends on the extent of the political community’s support to marriage and family
	- The Church needs to positively recognize the real challenges of married and family life and lead people form their conscience and discern according to the will of God.

## The Experiences and Challenges of Married and Family Life
---
-  Pope Francis exhortation **“Amoris Laetitia”**
	- considers the following experiences and challenges of marriage and family based in reality and the reports of two synods of families:
		- *migration,* 
		- *ideological denial of differences between the sexes (“ideology of gender”),* 
		- *the culture of the provisional to the anti-birth mentality,*
		- *the impact of biotechnology in the field of procreation,*

- The Pope also identifies **individualism** as the main reason why people find it *difficult to share themselves to another*.

## **Church** Teaching on Abortion
---
- ***Abortion***, the *deliberate ejection* of a non-viable *fetus* from the mother’s womb.
- A *direct attack* on human life and physical integrity. 
- Fails to *recognize*, *protect*, and *promote the dignity of the human person* from womb (conception). 
- Our faith tells us that God is the giver of life; he alone can take it back. 
- That is why God said: *“Thou shall not kill”*

## **Church** Teaching on Contraception
---
- ***Contraception***, considered as intrinsically **wrong**.
- ***Contraception***, refers to 
	- "any action which, either in anticipation of the conjugal act (sexual intercourse), or in its accomplishment, or in the development of its natural consequences, purposes, whether as an end or as a means, to *render procreation impossible*”.
- This includes all forms of contraceptives such as 
	- *cap,* 
	- *combined pills,* 
	- *condoms,* 
	- *contraceptive implant,* 
	- *contraceptive injection,* 
	- *contraceptive patch,*

## In-Vitro Fertilization
---
- ***In-Vitro Fertilization*** or ***IVF***, a medical procedure whereby an egg is fertilized by sperm in a test tube or elsewhere outside the body.
- The church does not support IVF

 The Russian Orthodox Church is re-examining its stance on in-vitro fertilization reproductive technology, in light of medical advances. A draft of the proposed document was published earlier this month on the official site of the Russian Church. Comments are being collected by the Inter-Council Presence of the Russian Church, until March 29th. President of the National Catholic Bioethics Center, Dr. Joseph Meaney, joins us to discuss the topic further. He shares what some of the major ethical concerns have been and how those concerns have been addressed by advancements in science. Dr. Meaney explains what the draft document indicates and what hasn't changed in terms of the Russian Church's position. He gives his opinion on what other factors are playing into the timing of this discussion and what kind of reaction this is generating. Meaney discusses what married couples should keep in mind regarding in-vitro fertilization, coming from a Catholic and ethical perspective.

## Annulment
---
- ***Annulment***, refers to a Catholic "declaration of nullity of a marriage contracted by Catholic spouses.
- The Church supports annulment if
	- it is invalid. 
	- consent from both spouses
	- the marriage was missing one or a few of the essential elements required of a marriage recognized by the Church, which are as follows: Both spouses are free to marry.
- A Church tribunal (a Catholic Church court) declares that a marriage thought to be valid according to Church law actually fell short of at least one of the essential elements required for a binding union.

## Cohabitation/"De Facto" Unions
---
- ***"Cohabitation" or Live-in or "De Facto"***, refers to the relationship between a sexually active man and woman who are living together even if they are not married. 
	- Includes a whole series of many heterogeneous human realities whose common element is that of being forms of cohabitation (of a sexual kind) which are not marriage.  
	- Characterized precisely by the fact that they ignore, postpone, or even reject the conjugal commitment.  Grave consequences are derived from this.

## Homosexuality
---
- In Christianity, every person is an adopted son/daughter of God.  Adoption demands rejection of any sinful act, including those acts that intend sexual arousal or stimulation between persons of the same sex. The Church teaches that such acts violate the divine and natural law. 
- The Church, however, clarifies that homosexual desires can only become sinful when these are acted out and deliberately engaged into through fantasies by persons with homosexual inclinations.

## Same-sex Marriage
---
- "The Church seeks to enable every person to live out the universal call to holiness. Persons with a homosexual inclination ought to receive every aid and encouragement to embrace this call personally and fully. This will unavoidably involve much struggle and self-mastery, for following Jesus always means following the way of the Cross...The Sacraments of the Eucharist and of Penance are essential sources of consolation and aid on this path."
