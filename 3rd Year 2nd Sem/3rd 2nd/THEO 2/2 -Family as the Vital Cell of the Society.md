- The church does not support IVF

 The Russian Orthodox Church is re-examining its stance on in-vitro fertilization reproductive technology, in light of medical advances. A draft of the proposed document was published earlier this month on the official site of the Russian Church. Comments are being collected by the Inter-Council Presence of the Russian Church, until March 29th. President of the National Catholic Bioethics Center, Dr. Joseph Meaney, joins us to discuss the topic further. He shares what some of the major ethical concerns have been and how those concerns have been addressed by advancements in science. Dr. Meaney explains what the draft document indicates and what hasn't changed in terms of the Russian Church's position. He gives his opinion on what other factors are playing into the timing of this discussion and what kind of reaction this is generating. Meaney discusses what married couples should keep in mind regarding in-vitro fertilization, coming from a Catholic and ethical perspective.

## Annulment
---
- ***Annulment***, refers to a Catholic "declaration of nullity of a marriage contracted by Catholic spouses.
- The Church supports annulment if
	- it is invalid. 
	- consent from both spouses
	- the marriage was missing one or a few of the essential elements required of a marriage recognized by the Church, which are as follows: Both spouses are free to marry.
- A Church tribunal (a Catholic Church court) declares that a marriage thought to be valid according to Church law actually fell short of at least one of the essential elements required for a binding union.

## Cohabitation/"De Facto" Unions
---
- ***"Cohabitation" or Live-in or "De Facto"***, refers to the relationship between a sexually active man and woman who are living together even if they are not married. 
	- Includes a whole series of many heterogeneous human realities whose common element is that of being forms of cohabitation (of a sexual kind) which are not marriage.  
	- Characterized precisely by the fact that they ignore, postpone, or even reject the conjugal commitment.  Grave consequences are derived from this.
