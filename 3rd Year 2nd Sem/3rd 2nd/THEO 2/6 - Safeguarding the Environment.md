## What is Happening to Our Common Home 

**Key Concepts.** Scientific studies in recent decades indicate that most global warming is a result of human activity that brings about great concentration of greenhouse gases and endangers the climate, our common home (LS no. 23). The harmful effects of the global problem on climate change have grave environmental, social, economic, political, and distribution of goods (LS no. 25). And it calls for an urgent need to develop policies to drastically reduce or substitute fossil fuels and develop sources of renewable energy (LS no. 26).

### **Summary of Main Points:**
1. **Ecological Crisis and Urgency:**
    - The planet is facing severe environmental degradation.
    - Human activity is largely responsible for climate change, pollution, and biodiversity loss.
    - There is an urgent moral responsibility to act.
2. **Pollution and Climate Change:**
    - Wasteful consumption and reliance on fossil fuels are major contributors.
    - Global warming affects the poorest most severely.
    - There's a need to transition to clean energy and reduce greenhouse gases.
3. **Water Scarcity:**
    - Clean drinking water is increasingly limited.
    - Water access is a basic human right under threat from privatization and contamination.
4. **Loss of Biodiversity:**
    - Human actions are causing mass extinction of species.
    - This threatens ecosystem stability and food security.
5. **Decline in Quality of Human Life and Breakdown of Society:**
    - Environmental degradation contributes to inequality, migration, and social unrest.
    - Urban overcrowding and pollution affect mental and physical health.
6. **Global Inequality:**
    - Wealthier nations and individuals are more responsible for environmental harm.
    - Poorer communities suffer the most and have the least ability to adapt.
7. **Weak Responses:**
    - Political responses are inadequate and often driven by economic interests.
    - There is a lack of global leadership and long-term vision.
8. **Need for a New Way of Thinking:**
    - A cultural shift is necessary—toward solidarity, care for creation, and a renewed ethical framework.
    - Technological solutions alone are insufficient without moral and spiritual conversion.

He identifies “throwaway culture” as the main cause of the problems on pollution and waste, scarcity of water, loss of biodiversity, decline in the quality of life and breakdown of society, extreme consumerism, and global inequality.

## The Gospel of Creation
---
**Key Concepts.** Everything that God created is intrinsically good. Though diverse yet united, for everything is entrusted to our care. Humanity presumes to be God and refuses to acknowledge its limitations. Humanity understands God’s command to “have dominion” as a license to exploit rather than to be responsible stewards of his creation.

---
The Church teaches that creation is a reflection of God's glory, and human beings—called to live in communion with all life—must protect and cherish it as a sacred trust.

---

Everything that created has its own value and significance. Everything is linked invincibly together and formed a kind of “universal family”. The universe invites all of humanity into a loving “communion” with God, with our neighbors, and the planet earth.

## The Human Roots of the Ecological Crisis
---
**Key Concepts.** The belief that humans are radically separate from and above the nonhuman natural world, anthropocentricism (LS nos. 115-118) devalues creation and values creation only to the extent that it is useful to humans (practical relativism” (LS nos. 118, 122). Technology has brought huge profits, without concern for its harmful effects to humanity (LS no. 109).

The ecological crisis is deeply rooted in human choices, especially the dominance of a technocratic mindset, extreme anthropocentrism, and cultural relativism. These human-centered and profit-driven ideologies lead to environmental destruction, social decay, and a loss of moral direction.

---
### **Summary of Main Points:**
1. **Technological Power Without Ethical Limits:**
    - Technological development has granted humanity immense power.
    - This power is often used without moral reflection or concern for the common good.
2. **Technocratic Paradigm:**
    - Nature is viewed as raw material to be manipulated for human gain.
    - Efficiency and profit are prioritized over sustainability and human dignity.
3. **Globalization and Consumerism:**
    - A culture of consumerism has become globalized, creating inequality and detachment from nature.
    - Economic systems reinforce a wasteful, throwaway culture.
4. **Excessive Anthropocentrism:**
    - Humanity sees itself as superior, justifying exploitation of nature and vulnerable people.
    - A proper understanding of stewardship is needed to rebalance this view.
5. **Ethical Decline and Practical Relativism:**
    - Ethics are sacrificed for convenience and profit.
    - Truth and responsibility are seen as subjective, weakening social and environmental concern.
6. **Value and Purpose of Work:**
    - Work is not merely economic; it is a source of dignity and participation in creation.
    - Technology should serve human work, not replace it.
7. **Concerns Over Biotechnology and GMOs:**
    - Genetic modification requires strict ethical oversight.
    - It risks displacing small farmers, reducing biodiversity, and creating dependency on corporations.

### **Key Terms:**
- **Technocratic Paradigm** – A worldview that exalts technology and control over nature without moral constraints.
- **Anthropocentrism** – Excessive human-centered thinking that disregards other life forms and ecosystems.
- **Practical Relativism** – The belief that values are subjective and can be overridden by personal convenience.
- **Throwaway Culture** – A consumerist mentality that treats people and resources as disposable.
- **Work and Human Dignity** – The idea that labor is a path to self-fulfillment and should not be replaced by machines.
- **Biotechnologies** – Scientific advancements that must be approached ethically to avoid exploitation and environmental harm.

Technology has successfully brought progress into the world and humanity has never had that power over itself. Technology had brought delusions of grandeur (LS no.114).

## Integral Ecology
---
**Key Concepts.** Everything that God created is interconnected. Creation is ultimately connected to the promotion of a preferential option for the poor and most vulnerable who are most affected by ecological degradation. It must be understood that commitment to the common good is “intergenerational” (LS no. 159.)

Integral ecology is a holistic approach that views environmental, economic, social, cultural, and spiritual crises as deeply interconnected. It calls for a united response that respects nature, human dignity, and the common good, rooted in justice and solidarity.

---
### **Summary of Main Points:**
1. **Everything is Interconnected:**
    - Environmental and social crises form one complex crisis.
    - Solutions must be integrated across disciplines and cultures.
2. **Environmental, Economic, and Social Ecology:**
    - Ecology must include human life, institutions, and economic systems.
    - Poor governance and injustice worsen ecological degradation.
3. **Cultural Ecology:**
    - Culture and tradition are part of ecological identity.
    - Indigenous knowledge and local wisdom must be respected and preserved.
4. **Ecology of Daily Life:**
    - Urban planning, housing, and public spaces impact well-being and community.
    - The poor often show resilience and creativity in harsh environments.
5. **The Common Good:**
    - Care for creation is inseparable from justice, peace, and respect for human dignity.
    - Social structures must ensure equitable access to resources and opportunities.
6. **Intergenerational Justice:**
    - We must care for future generations by addressing today’s crises responsibly.
    - A long-term ethical vision is needed to ensure sustainability.
7. **Call to Ecological Conversion:**
    - Cultural transformation requires moral and spiritual renewal.
    - Without changing hearts and values, systemic change is unsustainable.

### **Key Terms:**
- **Integral Ecology** – A comprehensive view linking environmental, social, economic, and cultural dimensions.
- **Common Good** – Conditions that enable all members of society to thrive, including future generations.
- **Ecological Conversion** – A spiritual transformation that leads to care for the Earth and others.
- **Intergenerational Justice** – Moral responsibility to preserve the planet for future generations.
- **Cultural Ecology** – The preservation of local traditions and values as part of environmental protection.
- **Human Ecology** – The relationship between human life, society, and the physical environment.

This is integral ecology: “The social and environmental crises are intertwined: “Strategies for a solution demand an integrated approach to combatting poverty, restoring dignity to the excluded, and at the same time protect-ing nature.” (LS no. 139).

## Lines of Approach
---
**Key Concepts:** The Catholic Social Teaching principle of subsidiarity teaches that challenges should be addressed at the lowest possible - but highest necessary – level of society is needed to protect and promote the common good. There is a need to move to affordable and renewable energy. Countries which benefited most of industrialization should subsidize developing countries to access to technology, technical transfer, and financial assistance (LS no. 170-171) enable them to participate in the process.
