## What is Happening to Our Common Home 

**Key Concepts.** Scientific studies in recent decades indicate that most global warming is a result of human activity that brings about great concentration of greenhouse gases and endangers the climate, our common home (LS no. 23). The harmful effects of the global problem on climate change have grave environmental, social, economic, political, and distribution of goods (LS no. 25). And it calls for an urgent need to develop policies to drastically reduce or substitute fossil fuels and develop sources of renewable energy (LS no. 26).

### **Summary of Main Points:**
1. **Ecological Crisis and Urgency:**
    - The planet is facing severe environmental degradation.
    - Human activity is largely responsible for climate change, pollution, and biodiversity loss.
    - There is an urgent moral responsibility to act.
2. **Pollution and Climate Change:**
    - Wasteful consumption and reliance on fossil fuels are major contributors.
    - Global warming affects the poorest most severely.
    - There's a need to transition to clean energy and reduce greenhouse gases.
3. **Water Scarcity:**
    - Clean drinking water is increasingly limited.
    - Water access is a basic human right under threat from privatization and contamination.
4. **Loss of Biodiversity:**
    - Human actions are causing mass extinction of species.
    - This threatens ecosystem stability and food security.
5. **Decline in Quality of Human Life and Breakdown of Society:**
    - Environmental degradation contributes to inequality, migration, and social unrest.
    - Urban overcrowding and pollution affect mental and physical health.
6. **Global Inequality:**
    - Wealthier nations and individuals are more responsible for environmental harm.
    - Poorer communities suffer the most and have the least ability to adapt.
7. **Weak Responses:**
    - Political responses are inadequate and often driven by economic interests.
    - There is a lack of global leadership and long-term vision.
8. **Need for a New Way of Thinking:**
    - A cultural shift is necessary—toward solidarity, care for creation, and a renewed ethical framework.
    - Technological solutions alone are insufficient without moral and spiritual conversion.

### **Key Terms:**
- **Laudato Si’** – Encyclical by Pope Francis on care for the environment.
- **Integral Ecology** – Concept connecting environmental, social, and spiritual dimensions.
- **Ecological Debt** – Disproportionate environmental burden on poor nations caused by wealthier ones.
- **Anthropocentrism** – Human-centered worldview criticized for justifying exploitation of nature.
- **Climate Change** – Human-driven global warming and its consequences.
- **Biodiversity** – Variety of life forms at risk due to human activity.
- **Common Good** – A principle advocating for societal well-being and equity in resource use.
- **Ecological Conversion** – A spiritual and moral awakening to our responsibilities toward creation.

Pope Francis emphasizes that the environment is a common good for it belongs to all of humanity. He identifies “throwaway culture” as the main cause of the problems on pollution and waste, scarcity of water, loss of biodiversity, decline in the quality of life and breakdown of society, extreme consumerism, and global inequality.

## The Gospel of Creation
---
**Key Concepts.** Everything that God created is intrinsically good. Though diverse yet united, for everything is entrusted to our care. Humanity presumes to be God and refuses to acknowledge its limitations. Humanity understands God’s command to “have dominion” as a license to exploit rather than to be responsible stewards of his creation.



Everything that created has its own value and significance. Everything is linked invincibly together and formed a kind of “universal family”. The universe invites all of humanity into a loving “communion” with God, with our neighbors, and the planet earth.
