## Main Ideas
---
***Property***:
- not merely a piece of land or some asset
- A relation of a person, juristic person, or entity with an object upon which such person holds a right over it
- *ex. land, houses, objects, shares, licenses, leases, patents, money, pensions, and certain types of welfare benefits.*

***Intellectual Property***:
- Intellectual property protection is critical to fostering innovation as it protects *genuine business assets*.
- Without the protection, owners would not receive full benefits and focus on research and development subsides.
- Artists, would not be fully compensated for their creations, and cultural vitality would suffer as a result.
