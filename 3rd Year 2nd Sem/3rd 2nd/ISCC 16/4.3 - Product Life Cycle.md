## Product Life Cycle
---
- A concept that seeks to describe a product's sales, competitors, customers, and marketing emphasis from its beginning until it is removed.
- Companies often desire a balanced product portfolio.
- The life cycle concept can be applied to a product class, a product form, and a product brand.

## Stages of the product Life Cycle
---
1. **Research & Development** - researching and developing a product before it is made available for sale in the market
2. **Introduction** – launching the product into the market
3. **Growth** – when sales are increasing at their fastest rate
4. **Maturity** – sales are near their highest, but the rate of growth is slowing down, e.g. new competitors in the market or saturation
5. **Decline** – the final stage of the cycle, when sales begin to fall

**Stages in Traditional Product Life Cycle:**
	In the traditional Product life cycle, the profit is negative in Introduction, slowly rises in Growth, peaks and then declines in Maturity stage and in the Decline stage.
