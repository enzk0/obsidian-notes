## Product Life Cycle
---
- A concept that seeks to describe a product's sales, competitors, customers, and marketing emphasis from its beginning until it is removed.
- Companies often desire a balanced product portfolio.
- The life cycle concept can be applied to a product class, a product form, and a product brand.

## Stages of the product Life Cycle
---
1. **Research & Development** - researching and developing a product before it is made available for sale in the market
2. **Introduction** – launching the product into the market
3. **Growth** – when sales are increasing at their fastest rate
4. **Maturity** – sales are near their highest, but the rate of growth is slowing down, e.g. new competitors in the market or saturation
5. **Decline** – the final stage of the cycle, when sales begin to fall

**Stages in Traditional Product Life Cycle:**
	In the traditional Product life cycle, the profit is negative in Introduction, slowly rises in Growth, peaks and then declines in Maturity stage and in the Decline stage.

## Extending the Product Life Cycle
---
Companies will wish to extend the profitable life of a product for as long as possible. If a company decides to continue selling the product as it reaches saturation or enters the decline phase, it is likely to extend the life of the product by introducing extension strategies to delay a product's decline.

## Why do Products Fail?
---
**Products Fail because of:**  
- Poor long-term planning
- Lack of a differential advantage
- Incorrect pricing and product placement
- Inattention to the environment of marketing and audit sequences
- Marketing myopia
- With proper marketing, some products might not fail

## New Product Planning Process
---
Long-term planning is required to launch a successful new product. One popular method to follow when developing a new product is to apply a phased step process as developed by **Robert G Cooper**. The different phases are shown in the diagram below:
