### Customer Segments
**Core Purpose:**  
Identify _who_ your business is creating value for — your most important customers or users.

**Key Questions to Answer**
- Who are we solving the problem for?
- Who will truly value our offering?
- Are our customers individuals, businesses, or both?
- What are their characteristics (age, gender, habits, etc.)?

 **Segment Dimensions**
- **Single vs. Multi-sided Market:**  
    Multi-sided markets (like media platforms) have separate customer groups (e.g., users and advertisers).
- **Customer Segmenting:**  
    Break your customer base into distinct groups based on shared traits (age, interests, spending habits, etc.).

**Segment Composition & Personas**
- **Macro vs. Micro View:**
    - _Macro:_ High-level segmentation (demographics, business type).
    - _Micro:_ Create detailed _Personas_ — fictional characters representing real users.
- **Think Like Them:**  
    Understand what they *see, think, feel, and do.*  
    Imagine their lifestyle — even down to the shoes they wear.
- **Include Both:**  
    Identify both *buyers* and *users* (they might not be the same).

**Problems, Needs, Habits & Alternatives**
- **Existing Needs:**  
    Don’t invent behaviors — identify _real_ problems or needs already present.
- **Current Solutions:**  
    What alternatives are customers currently using? Understand this to better position your product.

**Output**
- A *prioritized list of Personas*, organized by customer segment (if multiple segments exist).

**Final Note:**
This is one of the most *crucial sections* of your business model canvas. Your *Customer Segments* and *Value Propositions* drive everything else.

2. **Value Propositions**
	- What value do we deliver to your customers?
	- Which of your customer’s problems are you helping to solve?
	- What bundles of products and services are you offering to each customer?
	- What is unique about your Value Propositions and why does your customer prefer them to their Current Alternatives?
	- *Value of your product*
	- Output: A prioritized list of Value Propositions and linkages from each Personas to the VP's relevant to them.
		1. Performance
		2. Cost Reduction
		3. Convenience/Usability
3. **Customer Relationships**
	- What type of relationship does each of your Customer Segments expect you to establish and maintain with them?
	- How does the customer interact with you through the sales and product lifecycle? All the way through from promotion, to sale, to post-sale service?
	- Do the customers have a dedicated personal contact they see? or Call?, or is all the interaction over the web? Do they never see you at all but instead talk to a Channel? 
	- Is there a premium support product you need to create/test?  
	- Which ones have you established?  
	- How are they integrated with the rest of your business model?
	- *Maintain with your customer to adhere your value proposition*
