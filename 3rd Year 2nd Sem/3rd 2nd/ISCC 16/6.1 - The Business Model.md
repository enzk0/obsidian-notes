## Business Model

- A ***business model*** describes the rationale of how an organization creates, delivers, and captures value, in economic, social, cultural, or other contexts. 
- A *business model innovation* a process of business model construction and modification and forms a part of business strategy.

**Why should We Care about Business Models?**
1. Business Models are useful to ***think through all critical aspects of a business***: A checklist.
2. Business Models are useful to ***communicate your business concept through a 'common language'***.

### Customer Segments
---
***Core Purpose:***  
Identify _who_ your business is creating value for — your most important customers or users.

***Key Questions to Answer***
- Who are we solving the problem for?
- Who will truly value our offering?
- Are our customers individuals, businesses, or both?
- What are their characteristics (age, gender, habits, etc.)?

 ***Segment Dimensions***
- **Single vs. Multi-sided Market:**  
    Multi-sided markets (like media platforms) have separate customer groups (e.g., users and advertisers).
- **Customer Segmenting:**  
    Break your customer base into distinct groups based on shared traits (age, interests, spending habits, etc.).

***Segment Composition & Personas***
- **Macro vs. Micro View:**
    - _Macro:_ High-level segmentation (demographics, business type).
    - _Micro:_ Create detailed _Personas_ — fictional characters representing real users.
- **Think Like Them:**  
    Understand what they *see, think, feel, and do.*  
    Imagine their lifestyle — even down to the shoes they wear.
- **Include Both:**  
    Identify both *buyers* and *users* (they might not be the same).

***Problems, Needs, Habits & Alternatives***
- **Existing Needs:**  
    Don’t invent behaviors — identify _real_ problems or needs already present.
- **Current Solutions:**  
    What alternatives are customers currently using? Understand this to better position your product.

***Output***
- A *prioritized list of Personas*, organized by customer segment (if multiple segments exist).

Note:
This is one of the most *crucial sections* of your business model canvas. Your *Customer Segments* and *Value Propositions* drive everything else.

### Value Propositions
---
***Core Purpose:***  
Define the **unique value** your product or service delivers — why customers will choose _you_ over alternatives.

***Key Questions to Answer***
- What value do we bring to each customer?
- What specific problems are we solving?
- What products or services are we bundling for each customer group?
- Why would a customer prefer our solution over their current options?

***What Makes a Strong Value Proposition***
- Solves a **real**, existing problem or meets a clear need.
- Offers something that’s **better**, **easier**, or **more efficient** than current alternatives.
- Examples of common value propositions:
    - **Performance**
    - **Cost savings**
    - **Convenience/usability**
    - **Customization**
    - **Design/aesthetics**
    - **Brand/status**

 ***Link Value Propositions to Personas***
- Map each **Persona** (from Customer Segments) to the specific **Value Propositions** they care about.
   
> [!Note] Example
> Persona 1 → VP 1, VP 2   
> Persona 2 → VP 2   
> Persona 3 → VP 3

***Output***
- A **prioritized list** of your Value Propositions.
- A clear **mapping** that shows which Value Propositions are relevant to which Personas.

Note:
- This is one of the **most important parts** of your business model.  
- The _Customer Segment + Value Proposition_ pairing is what drives **traction**, **retention**, and ultimately **revenue**. Be laser-focused on what truly matters to your customers.

### Customer Relationships

- Do they interact directly with you, or through a **channel** (e.g., a third party)?
- Is there a **premium support tier** you should offer/test?
- How do these relationships vary **by segment/persona**?
 
***Customer Journey Touchpoints***
Consider how customers interact with you during:
- **Promotion/Discovery**

***Revenue Stream Mapping***
Link each **Revenue Stream** to:

This is the moment to reassess if your revenue sources are truly aligned with what your customers care about — and what keeps your business sustainable.
