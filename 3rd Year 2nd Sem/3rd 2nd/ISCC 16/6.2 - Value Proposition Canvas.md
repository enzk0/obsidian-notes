### Value Proposition Canvas
---
- initially developed by Dr. Alexander Osterwalder
- a framework to ensure a fit between the product and market
- created as a supplement to the Business Model Canvas (BMC)
- finds the "fit" between customer segments and the value proposition, which where the two most crucial sections to success
- VPC is formed around two blocks - customer profile and a company's value proposition
- VPC can be used to refine an existing product or service

***Why you Need the VPC?***
1. **See your value in a new way**  
	- The VPC can help you think differently about the value you provide to customers. When you have a list of the different factors that affect how your customers make decisions, it can help you find gaps in your value proposition
2. **Easy to understand**  
	- The VPC provides a visual representation of your value that’s easy to understand at a glance. That can come in handy in a variety of situations. 
3. **Better customer understanding**  
	- The PVC makes you more customer-centric. It urges you to see the situation from the customer’s point of view. And it brings your attention to all the right questions that will make you understand.
4. **Focus and product development direction**  
	- Knowing your value proposition makes it that much easier to get your product moving in the right direction.
5. **Messaging improvements**  
	- Finding the right message to attract new audiences is a pinnacle of success. Building your VPC is a way to find how you should approach your customers and what you need to promise them.

### Understanding the Value Proposition Canvas Layout
The **Value Proposition Canvas (VPC)**, created by **Alex Osterwalder**, is a tool designed to **ensure alignment between what a business offers and what its customers truly want**. It consists of **two main parts**:

 1. **Customer Profile**
	Start with this side to **focus entirely on the customer’s perspective**. Avoid thinking about your solution at this stage. Use customer interviews, message mining, or simple conversations to gather insights.
	- **Customer Jobs**: The **functional, emotional, and social tasks** customers are trying to accomplish.
	- **Pains**: The **challenges, obstacles, or negative experiences** customers face while trying to get those jobs done.
	- **Gains**: The **benefits or positive outcomes** customers desire—not just the opposite of pains, but also things that **delight or motivate** them.
2. **Value Proposition**
	After defining the customer side, shift to your solution—but do this **independently** to avoid bias.
	- **Products & Services**: The **actual offerings** you provide to meet the customer’s needs.
	- **Pain Relievers**: How your product or service **reduces or eliminates specific pains** from the Customer Profile.
	- **Gain Creators**: The features or benefits that **create added value** or enhance the customer’s experience.
    
**Achieving Fit**
The **ultimate goal** is to find a **“fit”** between your **value proposition** and the **customer profile**.
- A **true fit** happens when your offering addresses **50–70%** of the customer's jobs, pains, and gains.

- **Overlap matters**: Gain Creators can address Pains, and Pain Relievers can contribute to Gains. The VPC is **not linear**—interconnections are key.

**Validate and Iterate**
- **Documenting** your value proposition is only the **first step**.
- **Validation** with real customers is critical—get feedback on what actually matters to them.
- Use those insights to **refine and improve** your value proposition continuously.

**Key Takeaways**
- **Always start with the customer**, not the solution.
- **Don’t try to force-fit** your product to the customer's profile—honestly assess the match.
- **Focus on achieving fit**, not perfection.
- **Test, validate, and iterate** to make sure your value proposition remains relevant.
