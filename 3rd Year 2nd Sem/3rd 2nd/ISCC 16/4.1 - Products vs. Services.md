## What is a ***Product***?
---
A **product** is anything that can be *offered to a market* for attention, acquisition, use, or consumption and that might *satisfy* a *want* or *need*.

## What is a ***Service***?
---

A **service** is a form of product that consists of *activities*, *benefits*, or *satisfactions*.

Services offered for sale are essentially **intangible** and do not result in the ownership of anything.

***Nature and Characteristic of a Service:***  

| Characteristics    | Definition                                                       |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Intangibility**  | Can not be seen, tasted, felt, heard, or smelled before purchase |
| **Inseparability** | Can not be separated from service providers                      |
| **Variability**    | Quality depends on who provides them and when, where, and how    |
| **Perishability**  | Can't be stored for later sale or use                            |

- Ranges from *pure tangible goods* (with no services) *to pure services* (with no good component) with many combinations in between.

*example*
- Pure good:  Sugar
