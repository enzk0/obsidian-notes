## Prototypes
---
**Prototyping** is the process of creating an initial model of a product to test and refine its design. It serves as a reality check, helping to identify both strengths and weaknesses of an idea before scaling it up. For startups, prototyping is crucial because it allows them to discover user needs, gather feedback, and make improvements early on. Additionally, having a prototype increases the likelihood of securing investment, as it demonstrates a tangible version of the concept.


### Paper Prototyping
---
**Paper Prototyping** involves sketching product screens on paper as a low-fidelity substitute for digital prototypes. While it has limitations in testing complex features like graphics, usability, and navigation, it is perfect for early-stage conceptualizing. Its simplicity, speed, and ease make it ideal for brainstorming sessions and light usability testing early in the product development process.

### Digital Prototyping
---
**Digital Prototyping** is a virtual simulation of a product or service that helps test assumptions and explore the product before it's built. It can take various forms, from a working model to a simulation, and allows for the development of an MVP and product variations. By testing small elements and gathering customer feedback, startups can make informed decisions and prioritize development based on data rather than assumptions, ultimately saving time and money.
