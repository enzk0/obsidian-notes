### Labeling
---
Product **labeling** is a part of the packaging of a product. Labeling is the written information on the packages. These written labels on the package cover important information which needs to be communicated to a customer.  

Product labeling can be as less as simple one or two lines on the back of the product. Or it can be as much as the whole back end of the product being full of written information.  
  
**Importance of Labeling a Product:**  
1. **Brand and Product Identity** - The name of the product and the brand itself is considered as part of product labeling and these product labels form the brand identity
2. **Grade and Type of the Product** - Product labeling can be used to differentiate between the various grades and type of the product  
3. **Requirement by Law** - Numerous labeling requirements might be specified by a regulatory body. Some of them which are very common include Ingredients, manufacturing plant, batch number, expiry date, safety instructions, etc.  
4. **Description** - Some products use a manual to communicate the same whereas others imbibe usage instructions on the packaging itself
5. **Promotion** - Product labeling can become the last mile seller for your brand. A look at the product label can convert a prospect to a customer
6. **Additional Information** - There may be additional information on the product, of use to the customer, which can be used for product labeling

**Packaging vs. Labeling**  
	Product labeling is different from packaging. A product packaging might have the brand colors, the logo, and the material as well as the shape of the package, etc. The product label is the informational/written part.

### Product Support Services
---
**Product support services**, sometimes called **after-sales support** or **after-sales service**, is any service provided after a customer has purchased a product. Product support services may be provided by a retailer, manufacturer, or a third-party customer service or training provider.

Typically, examples of product support services include support regarding warranty service, training, or repair and upgrades. It may also be considered to be part of a company's overall marketing strategy. Some customers might seek out a company’s products based on its product support services  

**7 Most Common Types of After Sales Service:**  
1. **Pre-Installation services**   
	- While some products have very specific installation steps other products are customer-friendly. Products like a ceiling fan, air conditioner, washing machine, etc. require technical expertise for installation other products like mobile phones do not. Providing free pre-installation is one of the after-sales services.
2. **User training**  
	- Training of the end-user is another part of after-sales service. It is very essential that user training is provided since the user is going to be the one handling the product.
3. **Warranty services**  
	- This is perhaps the most common type of after-sales service provided by almost every company for almost every product. Warranty services include repairing replacement of selected parts for a selected period of time. For example, Apple provides complete care of iPhone for a period of one year from the date of purchase. 
4. **Online support**  
	- Companies are providing online support for any product-related queries. The customer may call the online support or chat as per his comfort, discuss the problem and get it resolved.
5. **Return/Replacement**  
	- For a limited period of time, some companies provide free replacement of the product in case of any defects. However, this is with certain terms and conditions. In some cases, replacement may be of the entire device, or in other cases, replacement may be only of the defective part.
	- In case of returns, the defective product is returned to the company and the customer is issued with either the store credit or replaced product or the amount is refunded.  
6. **Features and benefits**  
	- Some companies provide additional features for example replacement of a part for a lifetime, for free counseling for the entire duration of the product. Examples of this would be, Google provided free unlimited storage of photos on Google photos for all the pixel devices, similarly, Apple provides exchange or upgrade of old mobile phones with new mobile phones in the US, and Western Digital provided a lifetime warranty for the external hard disks. If for any reason, the hard disks are corrupted they are replaced for free of cost if within the limit.
7. **Upgrades**  
	- This usually works with software and electronics. Upgrading software for the device for a limited period is one of the types of after-sales service followed by companies. For example, Apple follows the policy of providing Over-The-Air (OTA) upgrades for iOS software for about 4-5 years. The same is followed in the case of Android phones. The mobiles get the software upgrade for a few years – depending on the model.
