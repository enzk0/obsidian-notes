## Network Media
---
***Network Media*** itself is:
- any form of media or channel used for data travel
- wired or wireless


| **Types of Network Media** |              |
| -------------------------- | ------------ |
| ***Guided Media***         | Coaxial      |
|                            | Twisted Pair |
|                            | Fiber optic  |
| ***Unguided Media***       |              |
### Guided Media
---
***Guided Media*** refers to:
- a wired communication
- the media signal guided from point to point
- data is sent and comes from electric signal

| **Cables in Unguided Media** |                                                                                                                                                      |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ***Coaxial Cable***          | - electric cable insulated copper conductor<br>- supports 100mbps                                                                                    |
| ***Twisted Cable***          | - copper wires twisted together<br>- have multiple pairs of wires<br>- supports 10gbps (CAT6)<br>- widely used in ethernet works                     |
| ***Fiber Optic Cable***      | - uses light photons to transfer data with minimal loss<br>- much more expensive<br>- used in WANs and long-distance cabling. *ex. submarine cables* |
### Unguided Media
---
***Unguided Media*** refers to:
- Wireless communication
- media signal propagated electromagnetic waves
- lossy and has latency

### Comparison between Guided and Unguided
---

| Guided                  | Unguided               |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------- |
| point-to-point          | all directions         |
| uses cable              | electromagnetic waves  |
| lower latency           | lossy, higher latency  |
| requires cable setup    | no cable setup needed  |
| good for short distance | good for long distance |

### Ethernet
---
- a way of connecting networks and computer in a physical space
- concept is in 1980, published by 1982
- IEEE or Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers
- has a standard

#### Ethernet Cables
---
- provide internet connection
- connect devices to LAN

#### Ethernet Structure
---
- twisted pair cable, industry standard, maximum length and speed run
- less electrical noise due to twisted pair balance
- eliminate noise, emi or electromagnetic interference
- minimize signals leaking, known as crosstalk

**Categories of Ethernet Cable**
- CAT, refers to different set of standards
	- CAT1, 1mb
	- CAT2, 4mb
	- CAT3, 10mb
	- CAT4, 16mb
	- CAT5, 100mb
	- CAT5e, 1gb
	- CAT6, 1g
	- CAT6a, 10gb
	- CAT7, 10gbps
	- CAT7a, 10gbps
	- CAT8.1, 25gbps
	- CAT8.2, 40gpbs


***Straight Through Cable***
- often known as patch cables used to connect different types of devices, like computer to routers

***Cross over cables***
- used to connect two devices of the same kind, like two computers

***Networks Cable***
- types of cable that connects computers and other devices to a networks
- backbone of a network
- allow communication within the network, send and receive

#### WHAT CABLING TO CHOOSE?!
---
***Coaxial Cable***
- electric cable that transmits radio frequency
- plastic jacket, metallic shield, dielectric insulator, then copper as core
- data and video travel through
- found in TVs
	
	*Advantages of Coaxial Cable*
	- reliable
	- cost effective
	- ease of installation

***Fiber Optics***
- complicated in splice and in assembling
- advanced type of network cable, improved performance
- higher bandwidth, no emi's, reduced signal attenuation, lesser weight, increased safety
- uses light photons to transfer data
