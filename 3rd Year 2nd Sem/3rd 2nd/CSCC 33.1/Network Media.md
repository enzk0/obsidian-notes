Network Media
- any form of media or channel used for data travel
- wired or wireless

1. Guided Media
	1. Coaxial
	2. Ethernet
	3. Fiber Optic
2. Unguided Media

Guided Media
- wired communication
- media signal guided from point to point
- data sent from electric signal
	- Coaxial cable
		- electric cable insulated copper conductor
		- supports 100mbps
	- Twisted Cable
		- copper wires twisted
		- multiple pairs of wires
		- 10gbps (CAT6)
		- widely used in ethernet works
	- Fiber Optic
		- uses light photons to transfer data with minimal loss
		- expensive
		- used in WANs and long-distance cabling *submarine cables*

Unguided Media
- Wireless communication
- media signal propagated electromagnetic waves
- lossy and has latency


| Guided                  | Unguided               |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------- |
| point-to-point          | all directions         |
| uses cable              | electromagnetic waves  |
| lower latency           | lossy, higher latency  |
| requires cable setup    | no cable setup needed  |
| good for short distance | good for long distance |

Ethernet
- a way of connecting networks and computer in a physical space
- 1980 by 1982
- IEEE or Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers
- Has a standard

Ethernet Cables
- provide internet connectoin
- connect devices to LAN

Ethernet Structure
- twisted pair cable, industry standard, maximum length and speedrun
- less electrical noise due to twisted pair balance
- eliminate noise
- minimize signals leaking, known as crosstalk

Straight Through cable
- often known as patch cables used to connect different types of devices

Cross over cables
- used to connect two devices of the same kind, like two computers
