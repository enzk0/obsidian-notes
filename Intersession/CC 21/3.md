# Cyberattacks and Cyber-Security
---
"There are only two types of companies in the world: those that have been breached and know it and those that have been breached and don't know it." - Ted Schlein

There is no perfect system.
- thus there are vulnerabilities

#### Cybercrime Prevention
- prevention is not sufficient
- preventive, detective, and corrective controls
- invest on detection to know what system has been breached as fast as humanly possible'

#### Computer Security
- no computer system is unbreakable
- Cybersecurity is only as strong as its weakest link
- Cybersecurity is about a TRUST.
	- Tho keep in mind that TRUST is also a BIAS, to yourself
	- Harm in trusting blindly
		- betrayals and exploitation might occur

#### Principles vs. Practices
"Principles are underlying truths that don't change over time and space, while practices are the application of principles to a particular situation" - Mary Poppendieck

**Why Zero Trust?**
- To reduce risks of Zero-Day Threats/Attacks

1. From a zero-day vulnerability
	- no patch, new bug
	- newly discovered
2. To a zero-day exploit
	- where attackers exploit the vulnerability
3. To a zero-day attack
	- when they take advantage of the exploit

Zero trust, a cybersecurity paradigm focuses on resource protection and the premise that trust us never granted implicitly but must be continually evaluated.

Three key principles:
1. Verify Explicitly
	- Always Authenticate and authorize based on all available data points, including user identity, location, device health, data classification, and anomalies
2. Least Privilege
	- Minimize user access with Just-In-Time and Just-Enough-Access, risk-based adaptive policies, and data protection which protects data and productivity
3. Assume Breach
	- Minimize scope of breach damage and prevent lateral movement by segmenting access via network, user, devices and application awareness. Verify all sessions are encrypted end to end. Use analytics to get visibility and drive threat detection.

Zero trust security model is based on the concept of =="never trust, always verify."==

Principles are based on applying the =="default deny"== security posture to various corporate assets, including
1. Zero Trust Networks
2. Zero Trust Workloads/Applications
3. Zero Trust Data
4. Zero Trust People/Users
5. Zero Trust Devices

#### What is a Risk?
- Risk is the possibility that Threats attack your Asset through a Vulnerability creating Loss

**CIA Triad**
1. Confidentiality
	- Protect and hide data from unauthorized access
2. Integrity
3. Availability

**Types of Threats to Information**
- Inadvertent Acts
- Deliberate Acts
- Natural Disasters
- Technical Failures
- Management Failures
- Malicious Software (Malware)
