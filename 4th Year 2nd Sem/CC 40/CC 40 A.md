What is AI?

##### Acting Humanly
- Turing Test approach
	- Tests intelligent behavior
	- Interrogator writes question and receives answers
	- Captchas (tests if the interacting agent is human)

##### Thinking Humanly
- *"How our brain functions"*
- 2 Approaches
	- Cognitive Science and Psychology
		- testing/predicting responses human subjects
		- if u get punched, ofc u dodge
	- Cognitive Neuroscience
		- thinking like the brain itself

##### Thinking Rationally
- *"Laws of thought"* approach
- *"Rational"* -> **ideal** intelligence
- Rational thinking governed by precise "laws of thought"
	- syllogisms
	- notation and logic
- Systems (in theory) can solve problems using such laws
- Obstacles:
	- Not easy to formalize informal knowledge, esp. involving uncertainty
		- Fuzzy Logic - probability of actions #researchmore
	- Exhaustion of computational resources

##### Acting Rationally
- Rational Agent Approach
	- Utilitarianism
	- carries out action to achieve the best outcome
- May or may not involve rational thinking 
	- like reflex, *i.e.* removing hand on a hot object
- If this, then that
