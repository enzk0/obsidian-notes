**Terms to remember:**
- Polytheism: many divine beings or gods
- Henotheism: worship one god out of many gods, the god of a tribe
- Monotheism: one god as the creator of all
- Pantheism: everything has an inner nature that is common to all - God

Due to modernization, we need to change the perspective from **"God up there"** to **"God out there"**

***All basic attributes of God should not be contradicting to one another.***
## Attributes of God
---
### Omnipotence
---
- He can do all things that in his power to do.
- **No contradiction** in terms - absolute impossibility; logically impossible
- He can do anything that is an **absolute possibility** and n*ot inconsistent with any of his basic attributes*
###  Omnibenevolence
---
- Worthy of *praise and worship*

*If God is good why is there evil?*
- Because God is not perfectly good
- His decisions giving us **freewill**

**Natural Evil**
- To yield for greater good

### Self-existence
---

God's existence is explained by **another?**
- from another

God's existence is explained by **nothing?**
 - if there is nothing, there should be something. This is contradicting

God's existence is explained by **itself?**
- the one that makes most sense

### Separation
---
- Rejects *pantheism*
	*"God cannot be within anyone of us, as there would be an end. There should be no end to God"*
- **Separate** and **independent** of the world
- Difference on *reality of God* and the *reality of the world*
	- Divine is **eternal**, mortal is ever **changing**

### Independent
---
- God should not be bounded nor governed of any law. *ex. laws of space and time*

**Human Time** is *Linear*:
1. Past
2. Present
3. Future

**Divine Time** is *All-present*:
- If God's time is divided into human time. Cannot be as anything divided is not *whole*
- God's time is **all-present**

*"All possibilities of us, are already present to God."*
###  Eternal
---
- concept of **endless**

Cannot be:
- **Temporal Existence**: no beginning nor end, infinite in both temporal directions. But this is **contradicting**. As God should not be bound in "temporal", as he is not bounded by **space** nor **time.**
