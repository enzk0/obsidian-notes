Today was the day of our onboarding, Ma'am Tina gave us the overview of what WELA is all about, its mission, its goals, its services, how things flows, the core values, the founders, the investors, the products and services that they provide, their activities, and on how they employees love WELA as a company. On the onboarding, Ma'am Tina also addressed our concerns and questions regarding our schedule, such as if we can avail overtime --- though the company did not recommend doing overtime especially to the interns --- another is the concerns regarding the MOA, our scheduling. Overall the onboarding was a really smooth process where we Atenean interns interacted with Ma'am professionally with a bit of humor interaction.

Later, we were asked to sit beside other two interns, which we did. We interacted and got to know the other inters that entered WELA. At a later time, we were adapted to WELA's main mode of communication, had our emails made, were assigned to our direct supervisors and the such.

I guess a takeaway that I could get for this day is that interacting with people brings a lot of thought and fun in its own way. Getting to know a person can be very challenging but having someone to talk to in a professional manner brings a new fresh experience to me in which I actually enjoyed.
